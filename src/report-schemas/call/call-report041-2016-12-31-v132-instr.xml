The specific reporting requirements depend upon the size of the bank and whether it has any "foreign" offices.  Banks must file the appropriate forms as described below:

(1) BANKS WITH FOREIGN OFFICES:  Banks of any size that have any "foreign" offices (as defined below) must file quarterly the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for a Bank with Domestic and Foreign Offices (FFIEC 031).  For purposes of these reports, all of the following constitute "foreign" offices:

	(a) an International Banking Facility (IBF);

	(b) a branch or consolidated subsidiary in a foreign country; and

	(c) a majority-owned Edge or Agreement subsidiary.

	In addition, for banks chartered and headquartered in the 50 states of the United States and the District of Columbia, a branch or consolidated subsidiary in Puerto Rico or a U.S. territory or possession is a "foreign" office.  However, for purposes of these reports, a branch at a U.S. military facility located in a foreign country is a "domestic" office.

(2) BANKS WITHOUT FOREIGN OFFICES:  Banks of any size that have only domestic offices must file quarterly the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for a Bank with Domestic Offices Only (FFIEC 041).  For banks chartered and headquartered in Puerto Rico or a U.S. territory or possession, a branch or consolidated subsidiary in one of the 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or a U.S. territory or possession is a "domestic" office.</label>

The time designated as the close of business should be reasonable and applied consistently.  The posting of a transaction to the general ledger means that both debit and credit entries are recorded as of the same date.  In addition, entries made to general ledger accounts in the period subsequent to the close of business on the report date that are applicable to the period covered by the Call Report (e.g., adjustments of accruals, posting of items held in suspense on the report date to their proper accounts, and other quarter-end adjusting entries) should be reported in the Call Report as if they had actually been posted to the general ledger at or before the cut-off time on the report date.

With respect to deposits received by the reporting bank after the cut-off time for posting them to individual customer accounts for a report date (i.e., so-called "next day deposits" or "late deposits"), but which are nevertheless posted in any manner to the reporting bank's general ledger accounts for that report date (including, but not limited to, through the use of one or more general ledger contra accounts), such deposits must be reported in Schedule RC-O, Other Data for Deposit Insurance and FICO Assessments, items 1 and 4, and may also be reported in Schedule RC, Balance Sheet, item 13, "Deposits," and Schedule RC-E, Deposit Liabilities.  However, the use of memorandum accounts outside the reporting bank's general ledger system for control over "next day" or "late deposits" received on the report date does not in and of itself make such deposits reportable in Schedule RC-O and Schedules RC and RC-E.</label>

	A bank may use computer software to prepare its report and then submit the report directly to the FFIEC's Central Data Repository (CDR), an Internet-based system for data collection (https://cdr.ffiec.gov/cdr/).

	The institution may complete its reports in paper form and arrange with a software vendor or another party to convert its paper reports into the electronic format that can be processed by the CDR.  The software vendor or other party then must electronically submit the data file containing the bank's Call Report to the CDR.

The filing of a Call Report in paper form directly with the FDIC (for national and FDIC-supervised banks) or with the appropriate Federal Reserve District Bank (for state member banks) is not an acceptable method of submission.

Regardless of the method a bank uses to file its Call Report, the bank remains responsible for the accuracy of the data in its Call Report.  Banks are required to submit a Call Report by the submission date (as defined below) that passes FFIEC-published validation criteria (validity edits and quality edits) or that contains explanations for any quality edits that are not passed.  These validation criteria are published in advance of each quarter end.  Specific "Guidelines for Resolving Edits" are available on the FFIEC's Web site (www.ffiec.gov/find/documents/resolvingedits.pdf).

In order to submit their completed reports to the CDR, banks (or third parties with whom they have made submission arrangements) must use software that meets the technical specifications for producing files that are able to be processed by the CDR.  (These technical specifications are available on the FFIEC's web site.)  Vendors whose software has been successfully tested with regard to this ability are listed in each quarter's Financial Institution Letter for the Call Report.  Alternatively, banks may develop their own reporting software and test directly with the CDR.  

Submitted reports that are unable to be processed by the CDR, or that have not been adequately validated by the bank, will be rejected and will require correction and resubmission.  In either case, if such resubmission is received by the CDR after the submission date for the report (as defined below), the submitting bank may be subject to the penalties prescribed for late submission.

Each bank is responsible for ensuring that the data reported each quarter reflects fully and accurately the item reporting requirements for that report date, including any changes that may be made from time to time.  This responsibility cannot be transferred or delegated to software vendors, servicers, or others outside the reporting bank.

A bank filing its Call Report with the CDR electronically or under the paper-based alternative must maintain in its files a signed and attested record of its completed report each quarter.  This record should be either a computer printout showing at least the caption of each item in the Call Report and the reported amount, a computer-generated facsimile of the report form, or a copy of the printed report form.  The signed cover page, as discussed under the "Signatures" section above, should be attached to the printout, computer-generated facsimile, or copy of the form that the bank places in its files.

State banks should refer to their appropriate state bank supervisory authority for information concerning state requirements for submitting copies of the Call Report filed with federal bank supervisory authorities.</label>

Except as indicated below, the CDR must receive the data file for a bank's Call Report, with all corrections made and all explanations provided consistent with the "Guidelines for Resolving Edits" (www.ffiec.gov/find/documents/resolvingedits.pdf), no more than 30 calendar days after the report date.  For example, the March 31 report must be received by April 30 and the June 30 report by July 30.

Any bank contracting with a third party to convert its reports to the electronic format for the CDR must ensure that it delivers its hard-copy reports to the third party in sufficient time for (1) the third party to enter the data into the appropriate format; (2) the bank to research and resolve any identified edit exceptions; and (3) the third party to electronically transmit the original submission and any necessary resubmissions to the CDR by the submission deadline.  Early submission is strongly encouraged so that the bank has ample time to research and resolve any edit exceptions identified through the submission process.  No extensions of time for submitting reports are granted.

Any bank that has more than one foreign office, other than a "shell" branch or an IBF, may take an additional limited period of time to submit its Call Report.  The CDR must receive the data file for such a bank's Call Report no more than 35 calendar days after the report date.  Eligible banks are urged to use the additional time only if absolutely necessary and to make every effort to report as soon as possible, preferably within the 30 day submission period.</label>

When dealing with the recognition and measurement of events and transactions in the Call Report, amended reports may be required if a bank's primary federal bank supervisory authority determines that the reports as previously submitted contain errors that are material for the reporting bank.  Materiality is a qualitative characteristic of accounting information that is addressed in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Concepts Statement No. 8, "Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting," as follows:  "Information is material if omitting it or misstating it could influence decisions that users make on the basis of the financial information of a specific reporting entity.  In other words, materiality is an entity-specific aspect of relevance based on the nature or magnitude or both of the items to which the information relates in the context of an individual entity's financial report."

See the Glossary entry for "subsidiaries" for the definition of "significant subsidiary."  Accordingly, the Call Report shall consolidate the operations of:

(1)  The bank's head office;

(2)  All branches of the bank, domestic and foreign;

(3)  Any IBF established by the bank;

(4)  All majority-owned Edge and Agreement subsidiaries, including their IBFs, their foreign and domestic branches, and their significant subsidiaries;

(7)  All nonsignificant majority-owned subsidiaries that the bank has elected to consolidate on a consistent basis in both the Report of Condition and the Report of Income.

Thus, the bank's investment in such a subsidiary is not eliminated in consolidation but will be reflected in the reports in the balance sheet item for "Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and associated companies" (Schedule RC, item 8) and other transactions of the bank with such a subsidiary will be reflected in the appropriate items of the reports in the same manner as transactions with unrelated outside parties. Additional guidance on this topic is provided in accounting standards, including FASB Statement No. 94 and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92.

Trust accounts - For purposes of the Call Report, the reporting bank's trust department is not to be consolidated into the reporting bank's balance sheet or income statement.  However, information concerning the bank's trust activities must be reported in Schedule RC-T, Fiduciary and Related Services.  Assets held in or administered by the bank's trust department and the income earned on such assets are excluded from all of the other schedules of the Call Report except when trust funds are deposited by the trust department of the reporting bank in the commercial or some other department of the reporting bank.

When such trust funds are deposited in the bank, they are to be reported as deposit liabilities in Schedule RC-E in the deposit category appropriate to the beneficiary.  Interest paid by the bank on such deposits is to be reported as part of the reporting bank's interest expense.

However, there are two exceptions:

(1) uninvested trust funds (cash) held in the bank's trust department, which are not included on the balance sheet of the reporting bank, must be reported in Schedule RC-O, Other Data for Deposit Insurance and FICO Assessments; and

(2) the fees earned by the trust department for its fiduciary activities and the operating expenses of the trust department are to be reported in the bank's income statement (Schedule RI) on a gross basis as if part of the consolidated bank.

Custody accounts - All custody and safekeeping activities (i.e., the holding of securities, jewelry, coin collections, and other valuables in custody or in safekeeping for customers) are not to be reflected on any basis in the balance sheet of the Report of Condition unless cash funds held by the bank in safekeeping for customers are commingled with the general assets of the reporting bank.  In such cases, the commingled funds would be reported in the Report of Condition as deposit liabilities of the bank.</label>

Unless the instructions specifically state otherwise, this consolidation shall be on a line-by-line basis, according to the caption shown.  As part of the consolidation process, the results of all transactions and all intercompany balances (e.g., outstanding asset/debt relationships) between offices, subsidiaries, and other entities included in the scope of the consolidated bank are to be eliminated in the consolidation and must be excluded from the Call Report.  (For example, eliminate in the consolidation (1) loans made by the bank to a consolidated subsidiary and the corresponding liability of the subsidiary to the bank, (2) a consolidated subsidiary's deposits in the bank and the corresponding cash or interest-bearing asset balance of the subsidiary, and (3) the intercompany interest income and expense related to such loans and deposits of the bank and its consolidated subsidiary.)

Subsidiaries of subsidiaries - For a subsidiary of a bank which is in turn the parent of one or more subsidiaries:

(1)  Each subsidiary shall consolidate its majority-owned subsidiaries in accordance with the consolidation requirements set forth above.

(2)  Each subsidiary shall account for any investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, corporate joint ventures over which the bank exercises significant influence, and associated companies according to the equity method of accounting.

Minority interests - A minority interest arises when the reporting bank owns less than 100 percent of the stock of a consolidated subsidiary.  The minority interest consists of the shares of stock not owned by the reporting bank.  Report minority interests in the reporting bank's consolidated subsidiaries in Schedule RC, item 22, "Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries," of the Report of Condition.  Report income (or loss) associated with such minority interests in Schedule RI, item 5.l, "Other noninterest income," of the Report of Income.

Intrabank transactions - (For banks with foreign offices.)  While all intrabank transactions are to be excluded from the Call Report, one intrabank relationship that is eliminated in consolidation is required to be identified and reported in the Report of Condition.  Specifically, Schedule RC-H, Selected Balance Sheet Items for Domestic Offices, requires the reporting of the net amount of "due from" or "due to" balances between the domestic offices and the foreign offices of the consolidated bank.

Deposit insurance and FICO assessments - When one FDIC-insured institution owns another FDIC insured institution as a subsidiary, the parent institution should complete items 1 through 11 (except item 9.a) and Memorandum items 1 through 5 of Schedule RC-O by accounting for the insured institution subsidiary under the equity method of accounting instead of consolidating it, i.e., on an "unconsolidated single FDIC certificate number basis."  (However, an FDIC-insured institution that owns another FDIC-insured institution should complete item 9.a of Schedule RC-O by consolidating its subsidiary institution.)  In contrast, when an FDIC-insured institution consolidates entities other than FDIC-insured institutions for purposes of Schedule RC, Balance Sheet, the parent institution should complete items 1 through 11 and Memorandum items 1 through 5 of Schedule RC-O on a consolidated basis with respect to these other entities.  However, all deposits of subsidiaries (except an insured depository institution subsidiary) that are consolidated and, therefore, eliminated from reported deposits on the balance sheet (Schedule RC, item 13.a or 13.b, as appropriate) must be reported in Schedule RC-O, items 1 through 3 and Memorandum items 1 and 2, as appropriate.  Similarly, the interest accrued and unpaid on these deposits, which is eliminated in consolidation from reported other liabilities on the balance sheet (Schedule RC, item 20), also must be reported in these Schedule RC-O items.

"Large institutions" and "highly complex institutions," including those that own another FDIC-insured institution as a subsidiary, should complete Memorandum items 6 through 18 of Schedule RC-O, as appropriate, on a fully consolidated basis.

Cutoff dates for consolidation - All branches must be consolidated as of the report date.  For purposes of consolidation, the date of the financial statements of a subsidiary should, to the extent practicable, match the report date of the parent bank, but in no case differ by more than 93 days from the report date.</label>

Nevertheless, because the Call Report is a bank-level report, each bank (together with its consolidated subsidiaries) is considered an "accounting entity" for regulatory reporting purposes and normally must prepare its Call Report on a separate entity basis.  Furthermore, when reporting events and transactions not covered in principle by Call Report instructions or authoritative GAAP standards, banks are encouraged to discuss the event or transaction with their primary federal bank supervisory agency.

Regardless of whether a bank discusses a reporting issue with its supervisory agency, when a bank's supervisory agency's interpretation of how GAAP should be applied to a specified event or transaction (or series of related events or transactions) differs from the bank's interpretation, the supervisory agency may require the bank to reflect the event(s) or transaction(s) in its Call Report in accordance with the agency's interpretation and to amend previously submitted reports.

The Call Report instructions contain certain specific reporting guidance that falls within the range of acceptable practice under GAAP.  These instructions have been adopted to achieve safety and soundness and other public policy objectives and to ensure comparability.  Should the need arise in the future, other specific reporting guidance that falls within the range of GAAP may be issued.  Current Call Report instructions providing such specific reporting guidance include the nonaccrual rules in the Glossary entry for "Nonaccrual Status," the treatment of impaired collateral dependent loans in the Glossary entry for "Loan Impairment," the Glossary entry for the "Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses" which references the 2006 Interagency Policy Statement on this subject, the separate entity method of accounting for income taxes of bank subsidiaries of holding companies in the Glossary entry for "Income Taxes," the push down accounting rules in the Glossary entry for "Business Combinations," and the treatment of property dividends in the Glossary entry for "Dividends."

Certain provisions of AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 92-3, "Accounting for Foreclosed Assets," have been incorporated into the Glossary entry for "Foreclosed Assets," which banks must follow for Call Report purposes, even though SOP 92-3 was rescinded subsequent to the issuance of FASB Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."  The application of these provisions of SOP 92-3 represents prevalent practice in the banking industry and is consistent with safe and sound banking practices and the accounting objectives set forth in Section 37(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

There may be areas in which a bank wishes more technical detail on the application of accounting standards and procedures to the requirements of these instructions.  Such information may often be found in the appropriate entries in the Glossary section of these instructions or, in more detail, in the GAAP standards.  Selected sections of the GAAP standards are referenced in the instructions where appropriate. The accounting entries in the Glossary are intended to serve as an aid in specific reporting situations rather than as a comprehensive statement on bank accounting.</label>

Furthermore, as discussed below under Shifts in Reporting Status, the amount of detail varies within the FFIEC 041 report form, primarily based on the size of the bank.  In general, the FFIEC 041 report form requires the least amount of detail from banks with less than $100 million in total assets.

Differences in the level of detail within both the FFIEC 031 and 041 report forms are as follows:

(1)  Banks that had closed-end loans with negative amortization features secured by 1-4 family residential properties with a carrying amount (before any loan loss allowances) that exceeded the lesser of $100 million or 5 percent of total loans and leases, net of unearned income, in domestic offices as of the previous December 31 report date must report certain information about these loans in Schedule RC-C, part I, Memorandum items 8.b and 8.c, and Schedule RI, Memorandum item 12.

(2)  Banks reporting average trading assets of $2 million or more for any of the four preceding quarters must complete Schedule RC-D, Trading Assets and Liabilities, items 1 through 15 and Memorandum items 1 through 3.b.  In addition, banks reporting average trading assets of $1 billion or more for any of the four preceding quarters must complete Memorandum items 4 through 10 of Schedule RC-D.

(3)  Banks reporting average trading assets of $2 million or more for any quarter of the preceding calendar year must provide a breakdown of their trading revenue by risk exposure in Schedule RI, Memorandum item 8, "Trading revenue."

(4)  Banks with less than $1 billion in total assets at which (a) closed-end and open-end first lien and junior lien 1-4 family residential mortgage loan originations and purchases for resale from all sources during a calendar quarter, or (b) closed-end and open-end first lien and junior lien 1-4 family residential mortgage loan sales during a calendar quarter, or (c) closed-end and open-end first lien and junior lien 1-4 family residential mortgage loans held for sale at calendar quarter-end exceed $10 million for two consecutive quarters must complete Schedule RC-P, 1-4 Family Residential Mortgage Banking Activities, beginning the second quarter and continue to complete the schedule through the end of the calendar year.

(5)  Banks with financial subsidiaries must complete certain additional items in Schedule RC-R, Regulatory Capital.

(6)  Banks servicing more than $10 million in financial assets other than 1-4 family residential mortgages must report the volume of such servicing in Schedule RC-S, Memorandum item 2.c.

(7)  Banks with total fiduciary assets greater than $100 million (as of the preceding December 31) or with gross fiduciary and related services income greater than 10 percent of revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) for the preceding calendar year must report information on their fiduciary and related services income and on fiduciary settlements and losses in Schedule RC-T.

In addition, within the FFIEC 031 report form, banks whose foreign office assets, revenues, or net income account for more than 10 percent of the bank's consolidated total assets, total revenues, or net income must complete Schedule RI-D, Income from Foreign Offices.</label>

Such a shift will take place only if the reporting bank's total assets (or, in one case, loans) as reflected in the Report of Condition for June of the previous calendar year equal or exceed the following criteria:

(1) On the FFIEC 041 report form, when total assets equal or exceed $100 million, a bank must begin to complete Schedule RC-K, items 7 and 13, for the quarterly averages of "Trading assets" and "Other borrowed money." 

(2) On the FFIEC 041 report form, when loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers exceed 5 percent of total loans, net of unearned income, at a bank with less than $300 million in total assets, the bank must begin to report the following information for these agricultural loans:  interest and fee income, quarterly average, past due and nonaccrual loans, and charge-offs and recoveries.

(3) On the FFIEC 041 report form, when total assets equal or exceed $300 million, a bank must begin to complete:

* Certain items providing additional detail on the composition of the loan and lease portfolio in Schedule RC-C, part I, Loans and Leases; past due and nonaccrual loans and leases in Schedule RC-N; and loan and lease charge-offs and recoveries in Schedule RI-B, part I;
* Schedule RC-A, Cash and Balances Due From Depository Institutions;
* Schedule RC-L, items 1.b.(1) and (2), on credit card lines by type of customer;1
* Schedule RC-N, Memorandum item 6, on past due derivative contracts; and 
* Schedule RI, Memorandum item 10, "Credit losses on derivatives." 

(4) On both the FFIEC 031 and FFIEC 041 report forms, when total assets equal or exceed $1 billion, a bank must begin to complete:

* Schedule RI, Memorandum item 2, "Income from the sale and servicing of mutual funds and annuities (in domestic offices)";
* Schedule RI-C, Disaggregated Data on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses;
* Schedule RC-B, Memorandum items 5.a through 5.f, which provide a breakdown of the bank's holdings of asset-backed securities;
* Schedule RC-L, items 2.a and 3.a, on financial and performance standby letters of credit conveyed to others;   
* Schedule RC-O, Memorandum item 2, "Estimated amount of uninsured deposits (in domestic offices of the bank and in insured branches in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions), including related interest accrued and unpaid"; and
* Schedule RC-P, 1-4 Family Residential Mortgage Banking Activities.

(5) On both the FFIEC 031 and FFIEC 041 report forms, when total assets equal or exceed $10 billion, a bank must begin to complete Schedule RC-L, item 16, "Over-the-counter derivatives."

Once a bank reaches the $100 million, $300 million, $1 billion, or $10 billion total asset threshold or exceeds the agricultural loan percentage or credit card lines threshold and begins to report the additional required information described above, it must continue to report the additional information in subsequent years without regard to whether it later falls below the total asset, loan percentage, or credit card lines threshold.

Other shifts in reporting status occur when:

(1) A bank with domestic offices only establishes or acquires any "foreign" office.  The bank must begin filing the FFIEC 031 report form (Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for a Bank with Domestic and Foreign Offices) for the first quarterly report date following the commencement of operations by the "foreign" office.  However, a bank with "foreign" offices that divests itself of all its "foreign" offices must continue filing the FFIEC 031 report form through the end of the calendar year in which the cessation of all operations of its "foreign" offices was completed.

(2) A bank is involved in a business combination (poolings of interests, purchase acquisitions), a reorganization, or a branch acquisition that is not a business combination.  Beginning with the first quarterly report date following the effective date of a business combination involving a bank and one or more other depository institutions, the resulting bank, regardless of its size prior to the business combination, must (a) file the FFIEC 031 report form if it acquires any "foreign" office, or (b) report the additional required information described above on the FFIEC 041 report form if its total assets or agricultural loans after the consummation of the transaction surpass the $100 million, $300 million, $1 billion, or $10 billion total asset threshold or the agricultural loan percentage. 

In addition, beginning with the first quarterly report date after an operating depository institution that was not previously a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) becomes an FDIC-insured bank, it must (a) file the FFIEC 031 report form if it has any "foreign" office, or (b) report the additional required information described above on the FFIEC 041 report form based on its total assets and agricultural loans at the time it becomes an FDIC insured bank. 


[1]  In addition, a bank with less than $300 million in total assets must begin to complete these items when credit card lines equal or exceed $300 million.  These total asset and credit card line thresholds also apply to the FFIEC 031 report form.</label>

(1)  The General Instructions describe overall reporting requirements.

(2)  The Line Item Instructions for each schedule of the Report of Income.

(3)  The Line Item Instructions for each schedule of the Report of Condition.

The instructions and definitions in sections (2) and (3) are not necessarily self contained; reference to more detailed treatments in the Glossary may be needed.

(4)  The Glossary presents, in alphabetical order, definitions and discussions of accounting issues and other topics that require more extensive treatment than is practical to include in the line item instructions or that are relevant to several line items or to the overall preparation of these reports.  The Glossary is not, and is not intended to be, a comprehensive discussion of the principles of bank accounting or reporting.

In determining the required treatment of particular transactions or portfolio items or in determining the definitions and scope of the various items, the General Instructions, the line item instructions, and the Glossary (all of which are extensively cross referenced) must be used jointly.  A single section does not necessarily give the complete instructions for completing all the items of the reports.

The instruction book is available on the Internet on the FFIEC's Web site (www.ffiec.gov/ffiec_report_forms.htm) and on the FDIC's Web site (www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/call/index.html).</label>

However, nonmember depository institutions may maintain their required reserves (in excess of vault cash) in one of two ways:  either (1) directly with a Federal Reserve Bank or (2) indirectly in an account with another institution (referred to here as a "correspondent"), which, in turn, is required to pass the reserves through to a Federal Reserve Bank.  This second type of  account is called a "pass-through account," and a depository institution passing its reserves to the Federal Reserve through a correspondent is referred to here as a "respondent."  This pass-through reserve relationship is legally and for supervisory purposes considered to constitute an asset/debt relationship between the respondent and the correspondent, and an asset/debt relationship between the correspondent and the Federal Reserve.  The required reporting of the "pass-through reserve balances" reflects this structure of asset/debt relationships.

	In the balance sheet of the respondent bank, the pass-through reserve balances are to be treated as a claim on the correspondent (not as a claim on the Federal Reserve) and, as such, are to be reflected in the balance sheet of the Report of Condition, Schedule RC, item 1.a, "Noninterest-bearing balances and currency and coin," or item 1.b, "Interest-bearing balances," as appropriate.  For respondent banks with foreign offices or with $300 million or more in total assets, the pass-through reserve balances would also be reflected in Schedule RC-A, item 2, "Balances due from depository institutions in the U.S."

	In the balance sheet of the correspondent bank, the pass-through reserve balances are to be treated as balances due to respondents and, to the extent that the balances have actually been passed through to the Federal Reserve, as balances due from the Federal Reserve.  The balances due to respondents are to be reflected in the balance sheet of the Report of Condition, Schedule RC, item 13.a, "Deposits in domestic offices," and on in Schedule RC-E, Deposit Liabilities, (part I), item 4.6  The balances due from the Federal Reserve are to be reflected on the balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 1.a, "Noninterest-bearing balances and currency and coin," and, for correspondent banks with foreign offices or with $300 million or more in total assets, in Schedule RC-A, item 4.</label>

The difference between the purchase price and par or face value represents the premium, which all banks are required to amortize.  

A discount arises when a bank purchases a security, loan, or other asset at a price below its par or face value, typically because the current level of interest rates for such assets is greater than its contract or stated rate of interest.  A discount is also present on instruments that do not have a stated rate of interest such as U.S. Treasury bills and commercial paper.  The difference between par or face value and the purchase price represents the discount that all banks are required to accrete.

Premiums and discounts are accounted for as adjustments to the yield on an asset over the life of the asset.  A premium must be amortized and a discount must be accreted from date of purchase to maturity, not to call or put date.  The preferable method for amortizing premiums and accreting discounts involves the use of the interest method for accruing income on the asset.  The objective of the interest method is to produce a constant yield or rate of return on the carrying value of the asset (par or face value plus unamortized premium or less unaccreted discount) at the beginning of each amortization period over the asset's remaining life.  The difference between the periodic interest income that is accrued on the asset and interest at the stated rate is the periodic amortization or accretion.  However, a straight line method of amortization or accretion is acceptable if the results are not materially different from the interest method

A premium or discount may also arise when the reporting bank, acting either as a lender or a borrower, is involved in an exchange of a note for assets other than cash and the interest rate is either below the market rate or not stated, or the face amount of the note is materially different from the fair value of the noncash assets exchanged.  The noncash assets and the related note shall be recorded at either the fair value of the noncash assets or the market value of the note, whichever is more clearly determinable.  The market value of the note would be its present value as determined by discounting all future payments on the note using an appropriate interest rate, i.e., a rate comparable to that on new loans of similar risk.  The difference between the face amount and the recorded value of the note is a premium or discount.  This discount or premium shall be accounted for as an adjustment of the interest income or expense over the life of the note using the interest method described above.

See "acquisition method" in the Glossary entry for "business combinations" for guidance on the recognition and initial measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination.

Subsequent Measurement of Goodwill - Goodwill should not be amortized, but must be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, as described below.  Any impairment losses recognized on goodwill during the year-to-date reporting period should be reported in Schedule RI, item 7.c.(1), "Goodwill impairment losses," except those impairment losses associated with discontinued operations, which should be reported on a net-of-tax basis in Schedule RI, item 11, "Extraordinary items and other adjustments, net of income taxes."  Goodwill, net of any impairment losses, should be reported on the balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 10.a.

Goodwill Impairment Testing - ASC Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other - Goodwill (formerly FASB Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets") provides guidance for testing and reporting goodwill impairment losses, a summary of which follows.  Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.  Because the fair value of goodwill can be measured only as a residual and cannot be measured directly, ASC Subtopic 350-20 includes a methodology for estimating the implied fair value of goodwill for impairment measurement purposes. 

Whether or not the reporting institution is a subsidiary of a holding company or other company, the institution's goodwill must be tested for impairment using the institution's reporting units.  Goodwill should be assigned to reporting units in accordance with ASC Subtopic 350-20.  The institution itself may be a reporting unit.

Goodwill of a reporting unit must be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.  Examples of such events or circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of.  In addition, goodwill must be tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of. 

When testing the goodwill of a reporting unit for impairment, an institution has the option of first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test described in ASC Subtopic 350-20.  If determined to be necessary, the two-step impairment test shall be used to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized (if any).  However, an institution may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment option for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test described below.

Qualitative Assessment - If an institution performs a qualitative assessment and, after considering all relevant events and circumstances, determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a re-porting unit is less than its carrying amount (including goodwill), then the institution does not need to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.  In other words, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount; an institution would not have to quantitatively test the unit's goodwill for impairment.  

However, if the institution instead concludes that the opposite is true (that is, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount), then it is required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test described below.  

ASC Subtopic 350-20 includes examples of events and circumstances that an institution should consider in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Because the examples are not all-inclusive, other relevant events and circumstances also must be considered.

Quantitative Impairment Test - 

*  Step 1:  The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit[1] with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than zero[2] and its fair value exceeds its carrying amount, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary.  However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

*  Step 2:   The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill[3] with the carrying amount of that goodwill.  If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of that goodwill, the goodwill is considered not impaired.  In contrast, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss must be recognized in earnings in an amount equal to that excess.  The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. 

After an impairment loss is recognized on a reporting unit's goodwill, the adjusted carrying amount of that goodwill (i.e., the carrying amount of the goodwill before recognizing the impairment loss less the amount of the impairment loss) shall be its new accounting basis.  Subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed. 

Disposal of a Reporting Unit - When a reporting unit is to be disposed of in its entirety, goodwill of that reporting unit must be included in the carrying amount of the reporting unit when determining the gain or loss on disposal.  When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with that business must be included in the carrying amount of the business in determining the gain or loss on disposal.  Otherwise, an institution may not remove goodwill from its balance sheet, for example, by "selling" or "dividending" this asset to its parent holding company or another affiliate.


[1]  The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
[2]  An institution should refer ASC Subtopic 350-20 for guidance on applying the quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative.
[3]  The implied fair value of goodwill should be determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined.  That is, an institution must assign the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.

Note that, in almost all cases, applicable income taxes as reported on the Report of Income will differ from amounts reported to taxing authorities.  The applicable income tax expense or benefit that is reflected in the Report of Income should include both taxes currently paid or payable (or receivable) and deferred income taxes.  The following discussion of income taxes is based on FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," and FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes."

Applicable income taxes in the year-end Report of Income shall be the sum of the following:

(1) Taxes currently paid or payable (or receivable) for the year determined from the bank's federal, state, and local income tax returns for that year.  Since the bank's tax returns will not normally be prepared until after the year-end Reports of Condition and Income have been completed, the bank must estimate the amount of the current income tax liability (or receivable) that will ultimately be reported on its tax returns.  Estimation of this liability (or receivable) may involve consultation with the bank's tax advisers, a review of the previous year's tax returns, the identification of significant expected differences between items of income and expense reflected on the Report of Income and on the tax returns, and the identification of expected tax credits.)

and

(2) Deferred income tax expense or benefit measured as the change in the net deferred tax assets or liabilities for the period reported.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets represent the amount by which taxes payable (or receivable) are expected to increase or decrease in the future as a result of "temporary differences" and net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that exist at the reporting date.

The actual tax liability (or receivable) calculated on the bank's tax returns may differ from the estimate reported as currently payable or receivable on the year-end Report of Income.  An amendment to the bank's year-end and subsequent Reports of Condition and Income may be appropriate if the difference is significant.  Minor differences should be handled as accrual adjustments to applicable income taxes in Reports of Income during the year the differences are detected.  The reporting of applicable income taxes in the Report of Income for report dates other than year-end is discussed below under "interim period applicable income taxes."

When determining the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be reported in any period, a bank's income tax calculation contains an inherent degree of uncertainty surrounding the realizability of the tax positions included in the calculation.  The term "tax position" refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities.  A tax position can result in a permanent reduction of income taxes payable, a deferral of income taxes otherwise currently payable to future years, or a change in the expected realizability of deferred tax assets.  For each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, a bank must evaluate whether the tax position is more likely than not, i.e., more than a 50 percent probability, to be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.  In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, a bank should presume that the taxing authority examining the position will have full knowledge of all relevant information.  A bank's assessment of the technical merits of a tax position should reflect consideration of all relevant authoritative sources, e.g., tax legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law, and reflect the bank's determination of the applicability of these sources to the facts and circumstances of the tax position.  A bank must evaluate each tax position without consideration of the possibility of an offset or aggregation with other positions.  No tax benefit can be recorded for a tax position that fails to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold.

Each tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Reports of Condition and Income.  The tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.  When measuring the tax benefit, a bank must consider the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement using the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date.  A bank may not use the valuation allowance associated with any deferred tax asset as a substitute for measuring this tax benefit or as an offset to this amount.

If a bank's assessment of the merits of a tax position subsequently changes, the bank should adjust the amount of tax benefit it has recognized and accrue interest and penalties for any underpayment of taxes in accordance with the tax laws of each applicable jurisdiction.  In this regard, a tax position that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent quarterly reporting period in which the threshold is met.  A previously recognized tax position that no longer meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent quarterly reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met.

Temporary differences result when events are recognized in one period on the bank's books but are recognized in another period on the bank's tax return.  These differences result in amounts of income or expense being reported in the Report of Income in one period but in another period in the tax returns.  There are two types of temporary differences.  Deductible temporary differences reduce taxable income in future periods.  Taxable temporary differences result in additional taxable income in future periods.

For example, a bank's provision for loan and lease losses is expensed for financial reporting purposes in one period.  However, for some banks, this amount may not be deducted for tax purposes until the loans are actually charged off in a subsequent period.  This deductible temporary difference "originates" when the provision for loan and lease losses is recorded in the financial statements and "turns around" or "reverses" when the loans are subsequently charged off, creating tax deductions.  Other deductible temporary differences include writedowns of other real estate owned, the recognition of loan origination fees, and other postemployment benefits expense.

Depreciation can result in a taxable temporary difference if a bank uses the straight-line method to determine the amount of depreciation expense to be reported in the Report of Income but uses an accelerated method for tax purposes.   In the early years, tax depreciation under the accelerated method will typically be larger than book depreciation under the straight-line method.  During this period, a taxable temporary difference originates.  Tax depreciation will be less than book depreciation in the later years when the temporary difference reverses. Therefore, in any given year, the depreciation reported in the Report of Income will differ from that reported in the bank's tax returns.  However, total depreciation taken over the useful life of the asset will be the same under either method.  Other taxable temporary differences include the undistributed earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and associated companies and amounts funded to pension plans that exceed the recorded expense.

Some events do not have tax consequences and therefore do not give rise to temporary differences. Certain revenues are exempt from taxation and certain expenses are not deductible.  These events were previously known as "permanent differences."  Examples of such events (for federal income tax purposes) are interest received on certain obligations of states and political subdivisions in the U.S., premiums paid on officers' life insurance policies where the bank is the beneficiary, and 70 percent of cash dividends received on the corporate stock of domestic U.S. corporations owned less than 20 percent.

Deferred tax assets shall be calculated at the report date by applying the "applicable tax rate" (defined below) to the bank's total deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards.  A deferred tax asset shall also be recorded for the amount of tax credit carryforwards available to the bank.  Based on the estimated realizability of the deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance should be established to reduce the recorded deferred tax asset to the amount that is considered "more likely than not" (i.e., greater than 50 percent chance) to be realized.

Deferred tax liabilities should be calculated by applying the "applicable tax rate" to total taxable temporary differences at the report date.

Operating loss carrybacks and carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards - When a bank's deductions exceed its income for federal income tax purposes, it has sustained an operating loss.  An operating loss that occurs in a year following periods when the bank had taxable income may be carried back to recover income taxes previously paid.  The tax effects of any loss carrybacks that are realizable through a refund of taxes previously paid is recognized in the year the loss occurs. In this situation, the applicable income taxes on the Report of Income will reflect a credit rather than an expense.  Banks may carry back operating losses for two years.

Generally, an operating loss that occurs when loss carrybacks are not available (e.g., occurs in a year following periods of losses) becomes an operating loss carryforward.  Banks may carry operating losses forward 20 years.

Tax credit carryforwards are tax credits which cannot be used for tax purposes in the current year, but which can be carried forward to reduce taxes payable in a future period.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards just as they are for deductible temporary differences.  As a result, a bank can recognize the benefit of a net operating loss for tax purposes or a tax credit carryforward to the extent the bank determines that a valuation allowance is not considered necessary (i.e., if the realization of the benefit is more likely than not).

Applicable tax rate - The income tax rate to be used in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities is the rate under current tax law that is expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or paid.  If the bank's income level is such that graduated tax rates are a significant factor, then the bank shall use the average graduated tax rate applicable to the amount of estimated taxable income in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.  When the tax law changes, banks shall determine the effect of the change, adjust the deferred tax asset or liability and include the effect of the change in Schedule RI, item 9, "Applicable income taxes (on item 8)."

Valuation allowance - A valuation allowance must be recorded, if needed, to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance generally shall be reported in Schedule RI, item 9, "Applicable income taxes (on item 8)."  The following discussion of the valuation allowance relates to the allowance, if any, included in the amount of net deferred tax assets or liabilities to be reported on the balance sheet (Schedule RC) and in Schedule RC-F, item 2, or Schedule RC-G, item 2. This discussion does not address the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets, if any, that is disallowed for regulatory capital purposes and reported in Schedule RC-R, item 9.

Banks must consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period. Four sources of taxable income may be available to realize the deferred tax assets:

(1) Taxable income in carryback years (which can be offset to recover taxes previously paid),

(2) Reversing taxable temporary differences,

(3) Future taxable income (exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.

(4) Tax-planning strategies.

In general, positive evidence refers to the existence of one or more of the four sources of taxable income. To the extent evidence about one or more sources of income is sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary (i.e., the bank can conclude that the deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized), other sources need not be considered. However, if a valuation allowance is needed, each source of income must be evaluated to determine the appropriate amount of the allowance needed.

Evidence used in determining the valuation allowance should be subject to objective verification. The weight given to evidence when both positive and negative evidence exist should be consistent with the extent to which it can be verified. Sources (1) and (2) listed above are more susceptible to objective verification and, therefore, may provide sufficient evidence regardless of future events.

The consideration of future taxable income (exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards) as a source for the realization of deferred tax assets will require subjective estimates and judgments about future events which may be less objectively verifiable.

Examples of negative evidence include:

* Cumulative losses in recent years.
* A history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused.
* Losses expected in early future years by a presently profitable bank.
* Unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future profit levels.
* A brief carryback or carryforward that would limit the ability to realize the deferred tax asset.

Examples of positive evidence include:

* A strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount (tax loss carryforward or deductible temporary difference) coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition.
* Existing contracts that will generate significant income.
* An excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of an entity's net assets in an amount sufficient to realize the deferred tax asset.

When realization of a bank's deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income, the reliability of a bank's projections is very important.  The bank's record in achieving projected results under an actual operating plan will be a strong measure of this reliability.  Other factors a bank should consider in evaluating evidence about its future profitability include but are not limited to current and expected economic conditions, concentrations of credit risk within specific industries and geographical areas, historical levels and trends in past due and nonaccrual assets, historical levels and trends in loan loss reserves, and the bank's interest rate sensitivity.

When strong negative evidence, such as the existence of cumulative losses, exists, it is extremely difficult for a bank to determine that no valuation allowance is needed.  Positive evidence of significant quality and quantity would be required to counteract such negative evidence.

For purposes of determining the valuation allowance, a tax-planning strategy is a prudent and feasible action that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and that management ordinarily might not take, but would do so to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused.  For example, a bank could accelerate taxable income to utilize carryforwards by selling or securitizing loan portfolios, selling appreciated securities, or restructuring nonperforming assets.  Actions that management would take in the normal course of business are not considered tax-planning strategies.

Significant expenses to implement the tax-planning strategy and any significant losses that would result from implementing the strategy shall be considered in determining any benefit to be realized from the tax-planning strategy.  Also, banks should consider all possible consequences of any tax-planning strategies. For example, loans pledged as collateral would not be available for sale.

The determination of whether a valuation allowance is needed for deferred tax assets should be made for total deferred tax assets, not for deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities.  In addition, the evaluation should be made on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.  Separate analyses should be performed for amounts related to each taxing authority (e.g., federal, state, and local).

Deferred tax assets (net of the valuation allowance) and deferred tax liabilities related to a particular tax jurisdiction (e.g., federal, state, and local) may be offset against each other for reporting purposes.  A resulting debit balance shall be included in "Other assets" and reported in Schedule RC-F, item 2.  A resulting credit balance shall be included in "Other liabilities" and reported in Schedule RC-G, item 2.  A bank may report a net deferred tax debit, or asset, for one tax jurisdiction (e.g., federal taxes) and also report a net deferred tax credit, or liability, for another tax jurisdiction (e.g., state taxes).

Interim period applicable income taxes - When preparing its year-to-date Report of Income as of the end of March, June, and September ("interim periods"), a bank generally should determine its best estimate of its effective annual tax rate for the full year, including both current and deferred portions and considering all tax jurisdictions (e.g., federal, state and local).  To arrive at its estimated effective annual tax rate, a bank should divide its estimated total applicable income taxes (current and deferred) for the year by its estimated pretax income for the year (excluding extraordinary items).  This rate would then be applied to the year-to-date pretax income to determine the year-to-date applicable income taxes at the interim date.

Intraperiod allocation of income taxes - When the Report of Income for a period includes "Extraordinary items and other adjustments" that are reportable in Schedule RI, item 11, the total amount of the applicable income taxes for the year to date shall be allocated in Schedule RI between item 9, "Applicable income taxes (on item 8)," and item 11, "Extraordinary items and other adjustments, net of income taxes."

The applicable income taxes on operating income (item 9) shall be the amount that the total applicable income taxes on pretax income, including both current and deferred taxes (calculated as described above), would have been for the period had "Extraordinary items and other adjustments" been zero.  The difference between item 9, "Applicable income taxes (on item 8)," and the total amount of the applicable taxes shall then be reflected in item 11 as applicable income taxes on extraordinary items and other adjustments.

Tax calculations by tax jurisdiction - Separate calculations of income taxes, both current and deferred amounts, are required for each tax jurisdiction.  However, if the tax laws of the state and local jurisdictions do not significantly differ from federal income tax laws, then the calculation of deferred income tax expense can be made in the aggregate.  The bank would calculate both current and deferred tax expense considering the combination of federal, state and local income tax rates.  The rate used should consider whether amounts paid in one jurisdiction are deductible in another jurisdiction.  For example, since state and local taxes are deductible for federal purposes, the aggregate combined rate would generally be (1) the federal tax rate plus (2) the state and local tax rates minus (3) the federal tax effect of the deductibility of the state and local taxes at the federal tax rate.

Income taxes of a bank subsidiary of a holding company - A bank should generally report income tax amounts in its Reports of Condition and Income as if it were a separate entity.  A bank's separate entity taxes include taxes of subsidiaries of the bank that are included with the bank in a consolidated tax return. In other words, when a bank has subsidiaries of its own, the bank and its consolidated subsidiaries are treated as one separate taxpayer for purposes of computing the bank's applicable income taxes.  This treatment is also applied in determining net deferred tax asset limitations for regulatory capital purposes.

During profitable periods, a bank subsidiary of a holding company that files a consolidated tax return should record current tax expense for the amount that would be due on a separate entity basis.  Certain adjustments resulting from the consolidated status may, however, be made to the separate entity calculation as long as these adjustments are made on a consistent and equitable basis.  For example, the consolidated group's single surtax exemption may be allocated among the holding company affiliates if such an allocation is equitable and applied consistently.  Such allocations should be reflected in the bank's applicable income taxes, rather than as "Other transactions with parent holding company" in Schedule RI-A, Changes in Equity Capital.

In addition, bank subsidiaries should first compute their taxes on a separate entity basis without considering the alternative minimum tax (AMT).  The AMT should be determined on a consolidated basis, and if it exceeds the regular tax on a consolidated basis, the holding company should allocate that excess to its affiliates on an equitable and consistent basis.  The allocation method must be based upon the portion of tax preferences, adjustments, and other items causing the AMT to be applicable at the consolidated level that are generated by the parent holding company and each bank and nonblank subsidiary.  In no case should amounts be allocated to bank subsidiaries that have not generated any tax preference or positive tax adjustment items.  Furthermore, the AMT allocated to banks within the consolidated group should not exceed the consolidated AMT in any year.

In future years when a consolidated AMT credit carryforward is utilized, the credit must be reallocated to the subsidiary banks.  The allocation should be done on an equitable and consistent basis based upon the amount of AMT giving rise to the credit that had been previously allocated.  In addition, the amount of AMT credit reallocated to affiliates within the consolidated group should not exceed the consolidated AMT credit in any year.  All AMT allocations should be reflected in the bank's applicable income taxes, rather than as "Other transactions with parent holding company" in Schedule RI-A, Changes in Equity Capital.

Similarly, bank subsidiaries incurring a loss should record an income tax benefit and receive an equitable refund from their parent, if appropriate.  The refund should be based on the amount they would have received on a separate entity basis, adjusted for statutory tax considerations, and shall be made on a timely basis.

An exception to this rule is made when the bank, on a separate entity basis, would not be entitled to a current refund because it has exhausted benefits available through carryback on a separate entity basis, yet the holding company can utilize the bank's tax loss to reduce the consolidated liability for the current year.  In this situation, realization of the tax benefit is assured.  Accordingly, the bank may recognize a current tax benefit in the year in which the operating loss occurs, provided the holding company reimburses the bank on a timely basis for the amount of benefit recognized.  Any such tax benefits recognized in the loss year should be reflected in the bank's applicable income taxes and not as an extraordinary item.  If timely reimbursement is not made, the bank cannot recognize the tax benefit in the current year.  Rather, the tax loss becomes a net operating loss carryforward for the bank.

A parent holding company shall not adopt an arbitrary tax allocation policy within its consolidated group if it results in a significantly different amount of subsidiary bank applicable income taxes than would have been provided on a separate entity basis.  If a holding company forgives payment by the subsidiary of all or a significant portion of the current portion of the applicable income taxes computed in the manner discussed above, such forgiveness should be treated as a capital contribution and reported in Schedule RI-A in "Other transactions with parent holding company" and in Schedule RI-E, item 5.

Further, if the subsidiary bank pays an amount greater than its separate entity current tax liability (calculated as previously discussed), the excess should be reported as a cash dividend to the holding company in Schedule RI-A, item 9.  Payment by the bank of its deferred tax liability, in addition to its current tax liability, is considered an excessive payment of taxes.  As a result, the deferred portion should likewise be reported as a cash dividend.  Failure to pay the subsidiary bank an equitable refund attributable to the bank's net operating loss should also be considered a cash dividend paid by the bank to the parent holding company.

Purchase business combinations - In purchase business combinations (as described in the Glossary entry for "business combinations"), banks shall recognize as a temporary difference the difference between the tax basis of acquired assets or liabilities and the amount of the purchase price allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities (with certain exceptions specified in FASB Statement No. 109).  As a result, the acquired asset or liability shall be recorded gross and a deferred tax asset or liability shall be recorded for any resulting temporary difference.

In a purchase business combination, a deferred tax asset shall generally be recognized at the date of acquisition for deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of either company in the transaction, net of an appropriate valuation allowance.  The determination of the valuation allowance should consider any provisions in the tax law that may restrict the use of an acquired company's carryforwards.

Subsequent recognition (i.e., by elimination of the valuation allowance) of the benefit of deductible temporary differences and net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards not recognized at the acquisition date will depend on the source of the benefit. If the valuation allowance relates to deductible temporary differences and carryforwards of the acquiring company established before the acquisition, then subsequent recognition is reported as a reduction of income tax expense.  If the benefit is related to the acquired company's deductible temporary differences and carryforwards, then the benefit is subsequently recognized by first reducing any goodwill related to the acquisition, then by reducing all other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition, and finally, by reducing income tax expense.

Alternative Minimum Tax - Any taxes a bank must pay in accordance with the alternative minimum tax (AMT) shall be included in the bank's current tax expense.   Amounts of AMT paid can be carried forward in certain instances to reduce the bank's regular tax liability in future years.  The bank may record a deferred tax asset for the amount of the AMT credit carryforward, which shall then be evaluated in the same manner as other deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed.

Other tax effects - A bank may have transactions or items that are reportable in Schedule RI-A of the Report of Income such as "Restatements due to corrections of material accounting errors and changes in accounting principles," and, on the FFIEC 031 only, "Foreign currency translation adjustments" that are included in "Other comprehensive income."  These transactions or other items will enter into the determination of taxable income in some year (not necessarily the current year), but are not included in the pretax income reflected in Schedule RI of the Report of Income.  They shall be reported in Schedule RI-A net of related income tax effects.  These effects may increase or decrease the bank's total tax liability calculated on its tax returns for the current year or may be deferred to one or more future periods.

A summary of this accounting guidance follows.  For further information, see AICPA Statement of Position 98-1.

	Internal-use computer software is software that meets both of the following characteristics:

	(1)	The software is acquired, internally developed, or modified solely to meet the bank's internal needs; and
 
	(2)	During the software's development or modification, no substantive plan exists or is being developed to market the software externally.

	Statement of Position 98-1 identifies three stages of development for internal-use software:  the preliminary project stage, the application development stage, and the post-implementation/operation stage.  The processes that occur during the preliminary project stage of software development are the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of the existence of needed technology, and the final selection of alternatives.  The application development stage involves the design of the chosen path (including software configuration and software interfaces), coding, installation of software to hardware, and testing (including the parallel processing phase).  Generally, training and application maintenance occur during the post-implementation/operation stage.  Upgrades of and enhancements to existing internal-use software, i.e., modifications to software that result in additional functionality, also go through the three aforementioned stages of development.

	Computer software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage should be expensed as incurred.

	Internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the application development stage should be capitalized.  Capitalization of these costs should begin once (a) the preliminary project stage is completed and (b) management, with the relevant authority, implicitly or explicitly authorizes and commits to funding a computer software project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended.  Capitalization should cease no later than when a computer software project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, i.e., after all substantial testing is completed.  Capitalized internal-use software costs generally should be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software.

	Only the following application development stage costs should be capitalized:

	(1)	External direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software;

	(2)	Payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal-use computer software project (to the extent of the time spent directly on the project); and

	(3)	Interest costs incurred when developing internal-use software.

Costs to develop or obtain software that allows for access or conversion of old data by new systems also should be capitalized.  Otherwise, data conversion costs should be expensed as incurred.  General and administrative costs and overhead costs should not be capitalized as internal-use software costs.

During the post-implementation/operation stage, internal and external training costs and maintenance costs should be expensed as incurred.

Impairment of capitalized internal-use computer software costs should be recognized and measured in accordance with FASB Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."

The costs of internally developed computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as a separate product or process should be reported in accordance with FASB Statement No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed."  If, after the development of internal-use software is completed, a bank decides to market the software, proceeds received from the license of the software, net of direct incremental marketing costs, should be applied against the carrying amount of the software.

An IBF is established in accordance with the terms of Federal Reserve Regulation D and after appropriate notification to the Federal Reserve.  The establishing entity may be a U.S. depository institution, a U.S. office of an Edge or Agreement corporation, or a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank pursuant to Federal Reserve Regulations D and Q.  An IBF is permitted to hold only certain assets and liabilities.  In general, IBF accounts are limited, as specified in the paragraphs below, to non-U.S. residents of foreign countries, residents of Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions, other IBFs, and U.S. and non-U.S. offices of the establishing entity.

Permissible IBF assets include extensions of credit to the following: 

(1) non U.S. residents (including foreign branches of other U.S. banks);

(2) other IBFs; and

(3) U.S. and non U.S. offices of the establishing entity.

Credit may be extended to non U.S. nonbank residents only if the funds are used in their operations outside the United States.  IBFs may extend credit in the form of a loan, deposit, placement, advance, security, or other similar asset.

Permissible IBF liabilities include (as specified in Federal Reserve Regulations D and Q) liabilities to non U.S. nonbank residents only if such liabilities have a minimum maturity or notice period of at least two business days.  IBF liabilities also may include overnight liabilities to:

(1) non U.S. offices of other depository institutions and of Edge or Agreement corporations; 

(2) non U.S. offices of foreign banks; 

(3) foreign governments and official institutions; 

(4) other IBFs; and 

(5) the establishing entity.

IBF liabilities may be issued in the form of deposits, borrowings, placements, and other similar instruments. However, IBFs are prohibited from issuing negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers acceptances, or other negotiable or bearer instruments.

Treatment of the reporting bank's IBFs in the Reports of Condition and Income - IBFs established by the reporting bank (i.e., by the bank or by its Edge or Agreement subsidiaries) are to be consolidated in the Reports of Condition and Income.  In the consolidated balance sheet (Schedule RC) and income statement (Schedule RI), transactions between the IBFs of the reporting bank and between these IBFs and other offices of the bank are to be eliminated.  (See the discussion of consolidation in the General Instructions section of this book.)

For purposes of these reports, the reporting bank's IBFs are to be treated as foreign offices of the bank. Thus, a bank with an IBF, even if it has no other foreign offices, must submit the Reports of Condition and Income applicable to banks with foreign offices (FFIEC 031).  Similarly, the reporting bank's IBFs are to be treated as foreign offices where, in the supporting schedules, a distinction is made between foreign and domestic offices of the reporting bank.

Assets of the reporting bank's IBFs should be reported in the asset categories of the report by type of instrument and customer, as appropriate.  For example, IBFs are to report their holdings of securities in Schedule RC, item 2, and in the appropriate items of Schedule RC B; their holdings of loans that the IBF has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff (including loans of immediately available funds that have an original maturity of one business day or roll over under a continuing contract that are not securities resale agreements) in Schedule RC, item 4.b, and in the appropriate items of Schedule RC C, part I; and securities purchased under agreements to resell in Schedule RC, item 3.b.

For purposes of these reports, all liabilities of the reporting bank's IBFs to outside parties are classified under four headings:  

(1) Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are to be reported in Schedule RC, item 14.b;

(2) Borrowings of immediately available funds that have an original maturity of one business day or roll over under a continuing contract that are not securities repurchase agreements, which are to be reported in Schedule RC-M, item 5.b; 

(3) Accrued liabilities, which are to be reported in Schedule RC, item 20; and 

(4) All other liabilities, including deposits, placements, and borrowings, which are to be treated as deposit liabilities in foreign offices and reported in Schedule RC, item 13.b, and by customer detail in Schedule RC E, part II.

In addition to being included in the appropriate items of the balance sheet, the total assets and total liabilities of the reporting bank's IBFs are to be reported separately in Schedule RC I, Assets and Liabilities of IBFs, by banks with IBFs and other "foreign" offices.  For a bank whose only foreign offices are IBFs, the total assets and liabilities of the reporting bank's IBFs are not reported separately in Schedule RC I, but are derived from Schedule RC H, Selected Balance Sheet Items for Domestic Offices.

Treatment of transactions with IBFs of other depository institutions - Transactions between the reporting bank and IBFs outside the scope of the reporting bank's consolidated Reports of Condition and Income are to be reported as transactions with depository institutions in the U.S., as appropriate.  (Note, however, that only foreign offices of the reporting bank and the reporting bank's IBFs are permitted to have transactions with other IBFs.)</label>

This financing device is essentially an extension of credit evidenced by an obligation between a lessee and a lessor.

Standards for lease accounting are set forth in FASB Statement No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," as amended and interpreted.

Accounting with bank as lessee - Any lease entered into by a lessee bank that meets certain criteria (defined in the following paragraph) shall be accounted for as a property acquisition financed with a debt obligation.  The property shall be amortized according to the bank's normal depreciation policy (except, if appropriate, the amortization period shall be the lease term) unless the lease involves land only.  The interest expense portion of each lease payment shall be calculated to result in a constant rate of interest on the balance of the debt obligation.  In the Report of Condition, the property "asset" is to be reported in Schedule RC, item 6, and the liability for capitalized leases in Schedule RC, item 16, "Other borrowed money."  In the Report of Income, the interest expense portion of the capital lease payments is to be reported in Schedule RI, item 2.c, "Interest on trading liabilities and other borrowed money," and the amortization expense on the asset is to be reported in Schedule RI, item 7.b, "Expenses of premises and fixed assets."

If any one of the following criteria is met, a lease must be accounted for as a capital lease:

	(1) ownership of the property is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term, or 

	(2) the lease contains a bargain purchase option, or
 
	(3) the lease term represents at least 75 percent of the estimated economic life of the leased property, or 

	(4) the present value of the minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term is 90 percent or more of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease less any related investment tax credit retained by and expected to be realized by the lessor.

If none of the above criteria is met, the lease should be accounted for as an operating lease.  Normally, rental payments should be charged to expense over the term of the operating lease as they become payable.

NOTE:  If a lease involves land only, the lease must be capitalized if either of the first two criteria above is met.  Where a lease that involves land and building meets either of these two criteria, the land and building must be separately capitalized by the lessee.  The accounting for a lease involving land and building that meets neither of the first two criteria should conform to the standards prescribed by FASB Statement No. 13.

Accounting for sales with leasebacks - Sale leaseback transactions involve the sale of property by the owner and a lease of the property back to the seller.  If a bank sells premises or fixed assets and leases back the property, the lease shall be treated as a capital lease if it meets any one of the four criteria above for capitalization.  Otherwise, the lease shall be accounted for as an operating lease.

As a general rule, the bank shall defer any gain resulting from the sale.  For capital leases, this deferred gain is amortized in proportion to the depreciation taken on the leased asset.  For operating leases, the deferred gain is amortized in proportion to the rental payments the bank will make over the lease term.  The unamortized deferred gain is to be reported in Schedule RC-G, item 4, "Other" liabilities.  (Exceptions to the general rule on deferral that permit full or partial recognition of a gain at the time of the sale may occur if the leaseback covers less than substantially all of the property that was sold or if the total gain exceeds the minimum lease payments.)

If the fair value of the property at the time of the sale is less than the book value of the property, the difference between these two amounts shall be recognized as a loss immediately.  In this case, if the sales price is less than the fair value of the property, the additional loss shall be deferred since it is in substance a prepayment of rent.  Similarly, if the fair value of the property sold is greater than its book value, any loss on the sale shall also be deferred.  Deferred losses shall be amortized in the same manner as deferred gains as described above.

For further information, see FASB Statement No. 28, "Accounting for Sales with Leasebacks."

Accounting with bank as lessor - Unless a long-term creditor is also involved in the transaction, a lease entered into by a lessor bank that meets one of the four criteria above for a capital lease plus two additional criteria (as defined below) shall be treated as a direct financing lease.  The unearned income (minimum lease payments plus estimated residual value plus initial direct costs less the cost of the leased property) shall be amortized to income over the lease term in a manner which produces a constant rate of return on the net investment (minimum lease payments plus estimated residual value plus initial direct costs less unearned income).  Other methods of income recognition may be used if the results are not materially different.

The following two additional criteria must be met for a lease to be classified as a direct financing lease:

	(1) Collectability of the minimum lease payments is reasonably predictable.

	(2) No important uncertainties surround the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by the lessor under the lease. 

When a lessor bank enters into a lease that has all the characteristics of a direct financing lease but where a long-term creditor provides nonrecourse financing to the lessor, the transaction shall be accounted for as a leveraged lease.  The lessor's net investment in a leveraged lease shall be recorded in a manner similar to that for a direct financing lease but net of the principal and interest on the nonrecourse debt.  Based on a projected cash flow analysis for the lease term, unearned and deferred income shall be amortized to income at a constant rate only in those years of the lease term in which the net investment is positive.  In the years in which the net investment is not positive, no income is to be recognized on the leveraged lease.

If a lease is neither a direct financing lease nor a leveraged lease, the lessor bank shall account for it as an operating lease.  The leased property shall be reported as "Other assets" and depreciated in accordance with the bank's normal policy.  Rental payments are generally credited to income over the term of an operating lease as they become receivable.</label>

(Such transactions are generally considered by federal bank supervisory agencies to represent "improper investment practices" for banks.)  In accounting for such transactions, the carrying amount of the security must be allocated between the ex-coupon security and the detached coupons based on their relative fair values at the date of the sale in accordance with FASB Statement No. 140.  (See the Glossary entry for "transfers of financial assets.")

Detached U.S. Government security coupons and ex-coupon U.S. Government securities that are held for purposes other than trading, whether resulting from the coupon stripping activities of the reporting bank or from its purchase of stripped securities, shall be reported as "Other domestic debt securities" in Schedule RC-B, item 6.a.  The amount of any discount or premium relating to the detached coupons or ex-coupon securities must be amortized.  (See the Glossary entry for "premiums and discounts.")

A variation of coupon stripping has been developed by several securities firms which have marketed instruments with such names as CATS (Certificates of Accrual on Treasury Securities), TIGR (Treasury Investment Growth Receipts), COUGAR (Certificates on Government Receipts), LION (Lehman Investment Opportunity Notes), and ETR (East Treasury Receipts).  A securities dealer purchases U.S. Treasury securities, delivers them to a trustee, and sells receipts representing the rights to future interest and/or principal payments on the U.S. Treasury securities held by the trustee.  Such Treasury receipts are not an obligation of the U.S. Government and, when held for purposes other than trading, shall be reported as "Other domestic debt securities" in Schedule RC-B, item 6.a.  The discount on these Treasury receipts must be accreted.

Under a program called Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPS), the U.S. Treasury has issued certain long-term note and bond issues that are maintained in the book-entry system operated by the Federal Reserve Banks in a manner that permits separate trading and ownership of the interest and principal payments on these issues.  Even after the interest or principal portions of U.S. Treasury STRIPS have been separately traded, they remain obligations of the U.S. Government.  STRIPS held for purposes other than trading shall be reported as U.S. Treasury securities in Schedule RC-B, item 1.  The discount on separately traded portions of STRIPS must be accreted.  

Detached coupons, ex-coupon securities, Treasury receipts, and U.S. Treasury STRIPS held for trading purposes shall be reported at fair value in Schedule RC, item 5.</label>

The remaining amount is credited to a separate dealer reserve account.  That account is held by the bank as collateral for the installment notes and, for reporting purposes, is treated as a deposit in the appropriate items of Schedule RC-E.  The bank will subsequently disburse to the dealer predetermined portions of the reserve as the purchased notes are paid in a timely manner.

	For example, if a bank purchases $100,000 in notes from a dealer for the full face amount ($100,000) and pays to the dealer $90,000 in cash or credits to his/her deposit account, the remaining $10,000, which is held as collateral security, would be credited to the dealer reserve account.

An unplanned overdraft occurs when a depository institution honors a check or draft drawn against a deposit account when insufficient funds are on deposit and there is no advance contractual agreement to honor the check or draft.  When a contractual agreement has been made in advance to allow such credit extensions, overdrafts are referred to as planned or prearranged.  Any overdraft, whether planned or unplanned, is an extension of credit and is to be treated and reported as a "loan" rather than being treated as a negative deposit balance.

	Planned overdrafts in depositors' accounts are to be classified in Schedule RC-C, part I, by type of loan according to the nature of the overdrawn depositor.  For example, a planned overdraft by a commercial customer is to be classified as a "commercial and industrial loan."

	Unplanned overdrafts in depositors' accounts are to be classified in Schedule RC-C, part I, as "All other loans," unless the depositor is a depository institution, a foreign government or foreign official institution, or a state or political subdivision in the U.S.  Such unplanned overdrafts would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 2, "Loans to depository institutions and acceptances of other banks," item 7, "Loans to foreign governments and official institutions," and item 8, "Obligations (other than securities and leases) of states and political subdivisions in the U.S.," respectively.  

	For purposes of treatment of overdrafts in depositors' accounts, a group of related transaction accounts of a single type (i.e., demand deposit accounts or NOW accounts, but not a combination thereof) maintained in the same right and capacity by a customer (a single legal entity) that is established under a bona fide cash management arrangement by this customer function as, and are regarded as, one account rather than as multiple separate accounts.  In such a situation, overdrafts in one or more of the 
transaction accounts within the group are not to be classified as loans unless there is a net overdraft position in the group of related transaction accounts taken as a whole.  (NOTE:  Affiliates and subsidiaries are considered separate legal entities.)  For further information, see "cash management arrangements."

	The reporting bank's overdrafts on deposit accounts it holds with other banks (i.e., its "due from" accounts) are to be reported as borrowings in Schedule RC, item 16, except overdrafts arising in connection with checks or drafts drawn by the reporting bank and drawn on, or payable at or through, another depository institution either on a zero-balance account or on an account that is not routinely maintained with sufficient balances to cover checks or drafts drawn in the normal course of business during the period until the amount of the checks or drafts is remitted to the other depository institution (in which case, report the funds received or held in connection with such checks or drafts as deposits in Schedule RC-E until the funds are remitted).</label>

Such accounts function as, and will be regarded for reporting and deposit insurance assessment purposes as, one account rather than separate accounts, provided adequate documentation of the arrangement is maintained as discussed below.  (Note:  For reporting and deposit insurance assessment purposes, transaction accounts of affiliates and subsidiaries of a parent company that are separate legal entities may not be offset because accounts of separate legal entities are not permitted within a bona fide cash management arrangement.)

	"Transaction accounts of a single type" means demand deposit accounts or NOW accounts, but not a combination thereof.  For purposes of cash management arrangements, the terms "right" and "capacity" relate to the form of legal ownership such as being held in an agency or trust capacity, as a joint tenant, or as an individual.  "Single legal entity" means a natural person, partnership, corporation, trust, or estate.

	The reporting bank must maintain readily available records that will allow for the verification of cash management arrangements.  Such documentation must provide account numbers, account titles, ownership of accounts, and the terms and conditions surrounding the management of the accounts, and must also clearly show that both the customer and the reporting bank have agreed to such terms and conditions.  These terms and conditions must clearly indicate the understanding that payments from one account will be honored as long as a net credit balance exists within the group of related transaction accounts taken as a whole and maintained in the same right and capacity.  A written cash management agreement, signed by both the customer (a single legal entity) and the reporting bank, accurately maintained and incorporating the above information, will be acceptable evidence of a bona fide cash management arrangement.  In addition, the reporting bank must maintain readily available records that will allow for the verification of account balances within cash management arrangements.

Arrival drafts are usually forwarded by the shipper to the collecting depository institution with instructions to release the shipping documents (e.g., bill of lading) conveying title to the goods only upon payment of the draft.  Payment, however, cannot be demanded until the goods have arrived at the drawee's destination.  Arrival drafts provide a means of insuring payment of shipped goods at the time that the goods are released.

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-line-770945_lbl_247" xml:lang="en">This entry covers, for purposes of these reports, the criteria for placing assets in nonaccrual status (presented in the general rule below) and related exceptions, the reversal of previously accrued but uncollected interest, the treatment of cash payments received on nonaccrual assets and the criteria for cash basis income recognition, the restoration of a nonaccrual asset to accrual status, and the treatment of multiple extensions of credit to one borrower.

General rule - Banks shall not accrue interest, amortize deferred net loan fees or costs, or accrete discount on any asset (1) which is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower, (2) for which payment in full of principal or interest is not expected, or (3) upon which principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the asset is both well secured and in the process of collection.

An asset is "well secured" if it is secured (1) by collateral in the form of liens on or pledges of real  or personal property, including securities, that have a realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt (including accrued interest) in full, or (2) by the guarantee of a financially responsible party.  An asset is "in the process of collection" if collection of the asset is proceeding in due course either (1) through legal action, including judgment enforcement procedures, or, (2) in appropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving legal action which are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status in the near future.

For purposes of applying the third test for nonaccrual status listed above, the date on which an asset reaches nonaccrual status is determined by its contractual terms.  If the principal or interest on an asset becomes due and unpaid for 90 days or more on a date that falls between report dates, the asset should be placed in nonaccrual status as of the date it becomes 90 days past due and it should remain in nonaccrual status until it meets the criteria for restoration to accrual status described below.

Any state statute, regulation, or rule that imposes more stringent standards for nonaccrual of interest takes precedence over this instruction.

Exceptions to the general rule - In the following situations, an asset need not be placed in nonaccrual status:

(1)  The criteria for accrual of income under the interest method specified in ASC Subtopic 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly AICPA Statement of Position 03-3, "Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer"), are met for a purchased credit-impaired loan, pool of loans, or debt security accounted for in accordance with that Subtopic, regardless of whether the loan, the loans in the pool, or debt security had been maintained in nonaccrual status by its seller.  (For purchased credit-impaired loans with common risk characteristics that are aggregated and accounted for as a pool, the determination of nonaccrual or accrual status should be made at the pool level, not at the individual loan level.)  For further information, see the Glossary entry for "purchased credit-impaired loans and debt securities."

(2)  The asset upon which principal or interest is due and unpaid for 90 days or more is a consumer loan (as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 6, "Loans to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures") or a loan secured by a 1-to-4 family residential property (as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.c, Loans "Secured by 1-4 family residential properties").  Nevertheless, such loans should be subject to other alternative methods of evaluation to assure that the bank's net income is not materially overstated.  However, to the extent that the bank has elected to carry such a loan in nonaccrual status on its books, the loan must be reported as nonaccrual in Schedule RC-N.

Treatment of previously accrued interest - The reversal of previously accrued but uncollected interest applicable to any asset placed in nonaccrual status should be handled in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Acceptable accounting treatment includes a reversal of  all previously accrued but uncollected interest applicable to assets placed in a nonaccrual status against appropriate income and balance sheet accounts.

For example, one acceptable method of accounting for such uncollected interest on a loan placed in nonaccrual status is (1) to reverse all of the unpaid interest by crediting the "accrued interest receivable" account on the balance sheet, (2) to reverse the uncollected interest that has been accrued during the calendar year-to-date by debiting the appropriate "interest and fee income on loans" account on the income statement, and (3) to reverse any uncollected interest that had been accrued during previous calendar years by debiting the "allowance for loan and lease losses" account on the balance sheet.  The use of this method presumes that bank management's additions to the allowance through charges to the "provision for loan and lease losses" on the income statement have been based on an evaluation of the collectability of the loan and lease portfolios and the "accrued interest receivable" account.

Treatment of cash payments and criteria for the cash basis recognition of income - When doubt exists as to the collectability of the remaining recorded investment in an asset in nonaccrual status, any payments received must be applied to reduce the recorded investment in the asset to the extent necessary to eliminate such doubt.  Placing an asset in nonaccrual status does not, in and of itself, require a charge off, in whole or in part, of the asset's recorded investment.  However, any identified losses must be charged off.

While an asset is in nonaccrual status, some or all of the cash interest payments received may be treated as interest income on a cash basis as long as the remaining recorded investment in the asset (i.e., after charge off of identified losses, if any) is deemed to be fully collectible.[1]  A bank's determination as to the ultimate collectability of the asset's remaining recorded investment must be supported by a current, well documented credit evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment, including consideration of the borrower's historical repayment performance and other relevant factors.

When recognition of interest income on a cash basis is appropriate, it should be handled in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  One acceptable accounting practice involves allocating contractual interest payments among interest income, reduction of the recorded investment in the asset, and recovery of prior charge-offs.  If this method is used, the amount of income that is recognized would be equal to that which would have been accrued on the asset's remaining recorded investment at the contractual rate.  A bank may also choose to account for the contractual interest in its entirety either as income, reduction of the recorded investment in the asset, or recovery of prior charge offs, depending on the condition of the asset, consistent with its accounting policies for other financial reporting purposes.

Restoration to accrual status - As a general rule, a nonaccrual asset may be restored to accrual status when (1) none of its principal and interest is due and unpaid, and the bank expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, or (2) when it otherwise becomes well secured and in the process of collection.  If any interest payments received while the asset was in nonaccrual status were applied to reduce the recorded investment in the asset, as discussed in the preceding section of this entry, the application of these payments to the asset's recorded investment should not be reversed (and interest income should not be credited) when the asset is returned to accrual status. 

For purposes of meeting the first test, the bank must have received repayment of the past due principal and interest unless, as discussed below, (1) the asset has been formally restructured and qualifies for accrual status, (2) the asset is a purchased credit-impaired loan, pool of loans, or debt security accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30 and it meets the criteria for accrual of income under the interest method specified therein, or (3) the borrower has resumed paying the full amount of the scheduled contractual interest and principal payments on a loan that is past due and in nonaccrual status, even though the loan has not been brought fully current, and the following two criteria are met.  These criteria are, first, that all principal and interest amounts contractually due (including arrearages) are reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period and, second, that there is a sustained period of repayment performance (generally a minimum of six months) by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms involving payments of cash or cash equivalents.  A loan that meets these two criteria may be restored to accrual status, but must continue to be disclosed as past due in Schedule RC-N until it has been brought fully current or until it later must be placed in nonaccrual status.

A loan or other debt instrument that has been formally restructured so as to be reasonably assured of repayment (of principal and interest) and of performance according to its modified terms need not be maintained in nonaccrual status, provided the restructuring and any charge off taken on the asset are supported by a current, well documented credit evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment under the revised terms.  Otherwise, the restructured asset must remain in nonaccrual status.  The evaluation must include consideration of the borrower's sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable period prior to the date on which the loan or other debt instrument is returned to accrual status.  A sustained period of repayment performance generally would be a minimum of six months and would involve payments of cash or cash equivalents.  (In returning the asset to accrual status, sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable time prior to the restructuring may be taken into account.)  Such a restructuring must improve the collectability of the loan or other debt instrument in accordance with a reasonable repayment schedule and does not relieve the bank from the responsibility to promptly charge off all identified losses.

A formal restructuring may involve a multiple note structure in which, for example, a troubled loan is restructured into two notes.  The first or "A" note represents the portion of the original loan principal amount that is expected to be fully collected along with contractual interest.  The second or "B" note represents the portion of the original loan that has been charged off and, because it is not reflected as an asset and is unlikely to be collected, could be viewed as a contingent receivable. The "A" note may be returned to accrual status provided the conditions in the preceding paragraph are met and:  (1) there is economic substance to the restructuring and it qualifies as a troubled debt restructuring under generally accepted accounting principles, (2) the portion of the original loan represented by the "B" note has been charged off before or at the time of the restructuring, and (3) the "A" note is reasonably assured of repayment and of performance in accordance with the modified terms.

Until the restructured asset is restored to accrual status, if ever, cash payments received must be treated in accordance with the criteria stated above in the preceding section of this entry.  In addition, after a formal restructuring, if a restructured asset that has been returned to accrual status later meets the criteria for placement in nonaccrual status as a result of past due status based on its modified terms or for any other reasons, the asset must be placed in nonaccrual status.

For further information on formally restructured assets, see the Glossary entry for "troubled debt restructurings."

Treatment of multiple extensions of credit to one borrower - As a general principle, nonaccrual status for an asset should be determined based on an assessment of the individual asset's collectability and payment ability and performance.  Thus, when one loan to a borrower is placed in nonaccrual status, a bank does not automatically have to place all other extensions of credit to that borrower in nonaccrual status.  When a bank has multiple loans or other extensions of credit outstanding to a single borrower, and one loan meets the criteria for nonaccrual status, the bank should evaluate its other extensions of credit to that borrower to determine whether one or more of these other assets should also be placed in nonaccrual status.


[1]   An asset in nonaccrual status that is subject to the cost recovery method required by ASC Subtopic 325-40, Investments-Other - Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets (formerly Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99-20, "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets"), should follow that method for reporting purposes.  In addition, when a purchased credit-impaired loan, pool of loans, or debt security that is accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30 has been placed on nonaccrual status, the cost recovery method should be used, when appropriate.</label>

ADC arrangements should be reported as loans, real estate joint ventures, or direct investments in real estate in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-10, Receivables - Overall (formerly AICPA Practice Bulletin 1, Appendix, Exhibit I, "ADC Arrangements").

12 USC 29 limits the authority of national banks to hold real estate.  National banks should review real estate ADC arrangements carefully for compliance.  State member banks are not authorized to invest in real estate except with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board under Federal Reserve Regulation H (12 CFR Part 208).  In certain states, nonmember banks may invest in real estate.

Under the agencies' regulatory capital rules, the term high volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) exposure is defined, in part, to mean a credit facility that, prior to conversion to permanent financing, finances or has financed the acquisition, development, or construction of real property.  (See section .2 of the regulatory capital rules and the instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 4.b.)  Institutions should note that the meaning of the term ADC as used in the definition of HVCRE exposure in the regulatory capital rules differs from the meaning of ADC arrangement for accounting purposes in ASC Subtopic 310-10 as described above in this Glossary entry.  For example, an institution's participation in the expected residual profit from a property is part of the accounting definition of an ADC arrangement, but whether the institution participates in the expected residual profit is not a consideration for purposes of determining whether a credit facility is an HVCRE exposure for regulatory capital purposes.  Thus, a loan can be treated as an HVCRE exposure for regulatory capital purposes even though it does not provide for the institution to participate in the property's expected residual profit.</label>

Each bank should also maintain, as a separate liability account, an allowance at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses associated with off-balance sheet credit instruments such as off-balance sheet loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and guarantees.  This separate allowance should be reported in Schedule RC-G, item 3, "Allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures," not as part of the "Allowance for loan and lease losses" in Schedule RC, item 4.c.

With respect to the loan and lease portfolio, the term "estimated credit losses" means an estimate of the current amount of loans and leases that it is probable the bank will be unable to collect given facts and circumstances as of the evaluation date.  Thus, estimated credit losses represent net charge-offs that are likely to be realized for a loan or pool of loans.  These estimated credit losses should meet the criteria for accrual of a loss contingency (i.e., through a provision to the allowance) set forth in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

As of the end of each quarter, or more frequently if warranted, the management of each bank must evaluate, subject to examiner review, the collectibility of the loan and lease portfolio, including any recorded accrued and unpaid interest (i.e., not already reversed or charged off), and make entries to maintain the balance of the allowance for loan and lease losses on the balance sheet at an appropriate level.  Management must maintain reasonable records in support of their evaluations and entries.  Furthermore, each bank is responsible for ensuring that controls are in place to consistently determine the allowance for loan and lease losses in accordance with GAAP (including FASB Statement No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," and FASB Statement No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan"), the bank's stated policies and procedures, management's best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance.

Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance account resulting from such evaluations are to be made through charges or credits to the "provision for loan and lease losses" (provision) in the Report of Income.  When available information confirms that specific loans and leases, or portions thereof, are uncollectible, these amounts should be promptly charged off against the allowance.  All charge-offs of loans and leases shall be charged directly to the allowance. Under no circumstances can loan or lease losses be charged directly to "Retained earnings."  Recoveries on loans and leases represent collections on amounts that were previously charged off against the allowance.  Recoveries shall be credited to the allowance, provided, however, that the total amount credited to the allowance as recoveries on an individual loan (which may include amounts representing principal, interest, and fees) is limited to the amount previously charged off against the allowance on that loan. Any amounts collected in excess of this limit should be recognized as income.

AICPA Statement of Position 03-3, "Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer," prohibits a bank from "carrying over" or creating loan loss allowances in the initial accounting for "purchased impaired loans," i.e., loans that a bank has purchased where there is evidence of deterioration of credit quality since the origination of the loan and it is probable, at the purchase date, that the bank will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable.  This prohibition applies to the purchase of an individual impaired loan, a pool or group of impaired loans, and impaired loans acquired in a purchase business combination.  However, if, upon evaluation subsequent to acquisition, based on current information and events, it is probable that the bank is unable to collect all cash flows expected at acquisition (plus additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimate after acquisition) on a purchased impaired loan (not accounted for as a debt security), the loan should be considered impaired for purposes of establishing an allowance pursuant to FASB Statement No. 5 or No. 114, as appropriate.

When a bank makes a full or partial direct write-down of a loan or lease that is uncollectible, the bank establishes a new cost basis for the asset.  Consequently, once a new cost basis has been established for a loan or lease through a direct write-down, this cost basis may not be "written up" at a later date.  Reversing the previous write-down and "re-booking" the charged-off asset after the bank concludes that the prospects for recovering the charge-off have improved, regardless of whether the bank assigns a new account number to the asset or the borrower signs a new note, is not an acceptable accounting practice.

The allowance account must never have a debit balance.  If losses charged off exceed the amount of the allowance, a provision sufficient to restore the allowance to an appropriate level must be charged to expense on the income statement immediately.  A bank shall not increase the allowance account by transferring an amount from undivided profits or any segregation thereof to the allowance for loan and lease losses.

To the extent that a bank's reserve for bad debts for tax purposes is greater than or less than its "allowance for loan and lease losses" on the balance sheet of the Report of Condition, the difference is referred to as a temporary difference.  See the Glossary entry for "income taxes" for guidance on how to report the tax effect of such a temporary difference.

Recourse liability accounts that arise from recourse obligations for any transfers of loans that are reported as sales for purposes of these reports should not be included in the allowance for loan and lease losses.  These accounts are considered separate and distinct from the allowance account and from the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures.  Recourse liability accounts should be reported in Schedule RC-G, item 4, "All other liabilities."

For comprehensive guidance on the maintenance of an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses, banks should refer to the Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses dated December 13, 2006.  For guidance on the design and implementation of allowance methodologies and supporting documentation practices, banks should refer to the interagency Policy Statement on Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Methodologies and Documentation for Banks and Savings Associations, which was published on July 6, 2001.  National banks should also refer to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's Handbook for National Bank Examiners discussing the allowance for loan and lease losses.  Information on the application of FASB Statement No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," to the determination of an allowance for loan and losses on those loans covered by that accounting standard is provided in the Glossary entry for "loan impairment."

Such loans and debt securities must be accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly AICPA Statement of Position 03-3, "Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer").  ASC Subtopic 310-30 does not apply to loans that an institution has originated.

Under ASC Subtopic 310-30, a purchased credit-impaired loan or debt security is initially recorded at its purchase price (in a purchase business combination, the present value of amounts to be received).  ASC Subtopic 310-30 limits the yield that may be accreted on the loan or debt security (the accretable yield) to the excess of the institution's estimate of the undiscounted principal, interest, and other cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected on the asset over the institution's initial investment in the asset.  The excess of the contractually required payments receivable on the loan or debt security over the cash flows expected to be collected, which is referred to as the nonaccretable difference, must not be recognized as an adjustment of yield, loss accrual, or valuation allowance.  Neither the accretable yield nor the nonaccretable difference may be shown on the balance sheet (Schedule RC).  After acquisition, increases in the cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively as an adjustment of the asset's yield over its remaining life.  Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as an impairment.

For purposes of applying the guidance in ASC Subtopic 310-30 to loans not accounted for as debt securities, an institution may aggregate loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter that have common risk characteristics and thereby use a composite interest rate and expectation of cash flows expected to be collected for the pool.  To be eligible for aggregation, each loan first should be determined individually to meet the scope criteria in the first sentence of this Glossary entry.  After determining that certain acquired loans individually meet these scope criteria, the institution may evaluate whether such loans have common risk characteristics, thus permitting the aggregation of such loans into one or more pools.  The aggregation must be based on common risk characteristics that include similar credit risk or risk ratings, and one or more predominant risk characteristics, such as financial asset type, collateral type, size, interest rate, date of origination, term, and geographic location.  Upon establishment of a pool of purchased credit-impaired loans, the pool becomes the unit of account.  

Once a pool of purchased credit-impaired loans is assembled, the integrity of the pool must be maintained.  An institution should remove an individual loan from a pool of purchased credit-impaired loans only if the institution sells, forecloses, or otherwise receives assets in satisfaction of the loan or if the loan is written off.  When an individual loan is removed from a pool of purchased credit-impaired loans under these circumstances, the loan shall be removed at its carrying amount.  Carrying amount is defined as the loan's current contractually required payments receivable less its remaining nonaccretable difference, accretable yield, and any post-acquisition loan loss allowance.  An institution that accounts for a pool of purchased credit-impaired loans with common risk characteristics as one unit of account may or may not document and maintain data on the nonaccretable difference and accretable yield on a loan-by-loan basis.  Accordingly, for purposes of determining the carrying amount of an individual loan in the pool, an institution may apply a systematic and rational approach to allocating the nonaccretable difference and accretable yield for the pool to an individual loan in the pool.  One acceptable approach is a pro rata allocation of the pool's total remaining nonaccretable difference and accretable yield to an individual loan in proportion to the loan's current contractually required payments receivable compared to the pool's total contractually required payments receivable.
     
A refinancing or restructuring of a loan within a pool of purchased credit-impaired loans should not result in the removal of the loan from the pool.  In addition, a modification of the terms of a loan within a pool of purchased credit-impaired loans is not considered a troubled debt restructuring under the scope exceptions in ASC Subtopic 310-40, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (formerly FASB Statement No. 15, "Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings," as amended).  However, a modification of the terms of a purchased credit-impaired loan accounted for individually must be evaluated to determine whether the modification represents a troubled debt restructuring that should be accounted for in accordance with ASC 310-40.  For further information, see the Glossary entry for "troubled debt restructurings."    

ASC Subtopic 310-30 does not prohibit an institution from placing a purchased credit-impaired loan accounted for individually, a pool of purchased credit-impaired loans with common risk characteristics, or a purchased credit-impaired debt security in nonaccrual status.  Because a loan (including a loan aggregated with other loans with common risk characteristics) or debt security accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30 has evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination, an acquiring institution must determine upon acquisition whether it is appropriate to recognize the accretable yield as income over the life of the loan, pool of loans, or debt security using the interest method.  In order to apply the interest method, the institution must have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of the cash flows expected to be collected on the loan, loan pool, or debt security.  Thus, when the amount and timing of the cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated at acquisition, the institution should place the purchased credit-impaired loan, pool, or debt security in nonaccrual status and then apply the cost recovery method or cash basis income recognition to the asset.  (For purchased credit-impaired loans with common risk characteristics that are aggregated and accounted for as a pool, the determination of nonaccrual or accrual status should be made at the pool level, not at the individual loan level.)  In addition, if a purchased credit-impaired loan or debt security is acquired primarily for the rewards of ownership of the underlying collateral, accrual of income is inappropriate and the loan or debt security should be placed in nonaccrual status.  The amount of a purchased credit-impaired loan, pool of loans, or debt security in nonaccrual status should be reported in the appropriate items of Schedule RC-N, Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans, Leases, and Other Assets, column C.  
	
When accrual of income on a purchased credit-impaired loan accounted for individually or a purchased credit-impaired debt security is appropriate (either at acquisition or at a later date when the amount and timing of the cash flows can be reasonably estimated), the delinquency status of the individual asset should be determined in accordance with its contractual repayment terms for purposes of reporting the amount of the loan or debt security as past due in the appropriate items of Schedule RC-N, column A or B.  When accrual of income on a pool of purchased credit-impaired loans with common risk characteristics is appropriate, delinquency status should be determined individually for each loan in the pool in accordance with the individual loan's contractual repayment terms for purposes of reporting the amount of individual loans within the pool as past due in the appropriate items of Schedule RC-N, column A or B.

ASC Subtopic 310-30 prohibits an institution from "carrying over" or creating loan loss allowances in the initial accounting for purchased credit-impaired loans.  This prohibition applies to the purchase of an individual impaired loan, a pool or group of impaired loans, and impaired loans acquired in a business combination.  However, for a purchased credit-impaired loan accounted for individually (and not accounted for as a debt security), if upon subsequent evaluation it is probable based on current information and events that an institution will be unable to collect all cash flows expected at acquisition (plus additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimate after acquisition), the purchased credit-impaired loan should be considered impaired for purposes of establishing an allowance pursuant to ASC Subtopic 450-20, Contingencies - Loss Contingencies (formerly FASB Statement No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies") or ASC Subtopic 310-10, Receivables - Overall (formerly FASB Statement No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan"), as appropriate.  For purchased credit-impaired loans with common risk characteristics that are aggregated and accounted for as a pool, this impairment analysis should be performed subsequent to acquisition at the pool level as a whole and not at the individual loan level.  An institution should include post acquisition allowances on purchased credit-impaired loans and pools of purchased credit-impaired loans in the overall allowance for loan and lease losses it reports in Schedule RC, item 4.c, and Schedule RI B, part II, item 7, and disclose the amount of these post-acquisition allowances in Schedule RI-B, part II, Memorandum item 4.

In Schedule RC-C, part I, Loans and Leases, an institution should report the amount of a purchased credit-impaired loan in the appropriate loan category (items 1 through 9).  Neither the accretable yield nor the nonaccretable difference associated with a purchased credit-impaired loan should be reported as unearned income in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 11.  In addition, an institution should report in Schedule RC-C, part I, Memorandum items 7.a and 7.b, the outstanding balance and amount, respectively, of all purchased credit-impaired loans reported as held for investment in Schedule RC-C, part I.  An institution also should report the outstanding balance and amount of those held-for-investment purchased credit-impaired loans reported in Schedule RC-C, part I, Memorandum items 7.a and 7.b, that are past due 30 through 89 days and still accruing, past due 90 days or more and still accruing, or in nonaccrual status as of the report date in Schedule RC-N, Memorandum items 9.a and 9.b, column A, B, or C, respectively, in accordance with the past due and nonaccrual guidance provided above in this Glossary entry.

These agreements are generally structured as nonqualified retirement plans for federal income tax purposes and are based upon individual agreements with selected employees. Institutions purchase life insurance in connection with many of these agreements.  Bank-owned life insurance may produce attractive tax-equivalent yields that offset some or all of the costs of the agreements.  

Deferred compensation agreements with select employees under individual contracts generally do not constitute postretirement income plans (i.e., pension plans) or postretirement health and welfare benefit plans.  The accounting for individual contracts that, when taken together, do not represent a postretirement plan should follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 12, "Omnibus Opinion - 1967," as amended by FASB Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (hereafter referred to as APB Opinion No. 12).  If the individual contracts, taken together, are equivalent to a plan, the plan should be accounted for under FASB Statement No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," or Statement No. 106.

APB Opinion No. 12 requires that an employer's obligation under a deferred compensation agreement be accrued according to the terms of the individual contract over the required service period to the date the employee is fully eligible to receive the benefits, i.e., the "full eligibility date."  Depending on the individual contract, the full eligibility date may be the employee's expected retirement date, the date the employee entered into the contract, or a date between these two dates.  APB Opinion No. 12 does not prescribe a specific accrual method for the benefits under deferred compensation contracts, stating only that the "cost of those benefits shall be accrued over that period of the employee's service in a systematic and rational manner."  The amounts to be accrued each period should result in a deferred compensation liability at the full eligibility date that equals the then present value of the estimated benefit payments to be made under the individual contract.  

APB Opinion No. 12 does not specify how to select the discount rate to measure the present value of the estimated benefit payments.  Therefore, other relevant accounting literature must be considered in determining an appropriate discount rate.  For purposes of these reports, an institution's incremental borrowing rate1 and the current rate of return on high-quality fixed-income debt securities2 are acceptable discount rates to measure deferred compensation agreement obligations.  An institution must select and consistently apply a discount rate policy that conforms with generally accepted accounting principles.    
For each deferred compensation agreement to be accounted for in accordance with APB Opinion No. 12, an institution should calculate the present value of the expected future benefit payments under the agreement at the employee's full eligibility date.  The expected future benefit payments can be reasonably estimated and should be based on reasonable and supportable assumptions.  The estimated amount of these benefit payments should be discounted because the benefits will be paid in periodic installments after the employee retires. 

For deferred compensation agreements commonly referred to as revenue neutral or indexed retirement plans,3 the expected future benefits should include both the "primary benefit" and, if the employee is entitled to "excess earnings" that are earned after retirement, the "secondary benefit."  The number of periods the primary and any secondary benefit payments should be discounted may differ because the discount period for each type of benefit payment should be based upon the length of time during which each type of benefit will be paid as specified in the deferred compensation agreement.
  
After the present value of the expected future benefit payments has been determined, an institution should accrue an amount of compensation expense and a liability each year from the date the employee enters into the deferred compensation agreement until the full eligibility date.  The amount of these annual accruals should be sufficient to ensure that a deferred compensation liability equal to the present value of the expected benefit payments is recorded by the full eligibility date.  Any method of deferred compensation accounting that does not recognize some expense in each year from the date the employee enters into the agreement until the full eligibility date is not systematic and rational.   (For indexed retirement plans, some expense should be recognized for the primary benefit and any secondary benefit in each of these years.)

Vesting provisions should be reviewed to ensure that the full eligibility date is properly determined because this date is critical to the measurement of the liability estimate.  Because APB Opinion No. 12 requires that the present value of the expected benefit payments be recorded by the full eligibility date, institutions also need to consider changes in market interest rates to appropriately measure deferred compensation liabilities.  Therefore, institutions should periodically review their estimates of the expected future benefits under deferred compensation agreements and the discount rates used to compute the present value of the expected benefit payments and revise the estimates and rates, when appropriate.      

Deferred compensation agreements may include noncompete provisions or provisions requiring employees to perform consulting services during postretirement years.  If the value of the noncompete provisions cannot be reasonably and reliably estimated, no value should be assigned to the noncompete provisions in recognizing the deferred compensation liability.  Institutions should allocate a portion of the future benefit payments to consulting services to be performed in postretirement years only if the consulting services are determined to be substantive.  Factors to consider in determining whether postretirement consulting services are substantive include, but are not limited to, whether the services are required to be performed, whether there is an economic benefit to the institution, and whether the employee forfeits the benefits under the agreement for failure to perform such services.
		
Deferred compensation liabilities should be reported on the balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 20, "Other liabilities," and in Schedule RC-G, item 4, "All other liabilities."  If this amount is greater than $25,000 and exceeds 25 percent of the amount reported in Schedule RC-G, item 4, it should be reported in Schedule RC-G, item 4.b.  The annual compensation expense (service component and interest component) related to deferred compensation agreements should be reported in the income statement in Schedule RI, item 7.a, "Salaries and employee benefits."

[1]  APB Opinion No. 21,"Interest on Receivables and Payables," paragraph 13, states in part that "the rate used for valuation purposes will normally be at least equal to the rate at which the debtor can obtain financing of a similar nature from other sources at the date of the transaction."

[2]  FASB Statement No.  106, paragraph 186, states that "[t]he objective of selecting assumed discount rates is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due."

[3]  Revenue neutral and indexed retirement plans are deferred compensation agreements that are typically designed so that the spread each year, if any, between the tax-equivalent earnings on bank-owned life insurance covering an individual employee and a hypothetical earnings calculation is deferred and paid to the employee as a postretirement benefit.  This spread is commonly referred to as "excess earnings."  The hypothetical earnings are computed based on a pre-defined variable index rate (e.g., cost of funds or federal funds rate) times a notional amount.  The agreement for this type of plan typically requires the excess earnings that accrue before an employee's retirement to be recorded in a separate liability account.  Once the employee retires, the balance in the liability account is generally paid to the employee in equal annual installments over a set number of years (e.g., 10 or 15 years).  These payments are commonly referred to as the "primary benefit" or "preretirement benefit."  The employee may also receive the excess earnings that are earned after retirement.  This benefit may continue until his or her death and is commonly referred to as the "secondary benefit" or "postretirement benefit."  The secondary benefit is paid annually, once the employee has retired, in addition to the primary benefit.</label>

For further information, see the Glossary entry for "Derivative Contracts."  Examples of equity-indexed certificates of deposit include the "Index Powered CD" and the "Dow Jones Industrials Indexed Certificate of Deposit."

At the maturity date of a typical equity-indexed certificate of deposit, the holder of the certificate of deposit receives the original amount invested in the deposit plus some or all of the appreciation, if any, in an index of stock prices over the term of the certificate of deposit.  Thus, the equity-indexed certificate of deposit contains an embedded equity call option.  To manage the market risk of its equity-indexed certificates of deposit, a bank that issues these deposits normally enters into one or more separate freestanding equity derivative contracts with an overall term that matches the term of the certificates of deposit.  At maturity, these separate derivatives are expected to provide the bank with a cash payment in an amount equal to the amount of appreciation, if any, in the same stock price index that is embedded in the certificates of deposit, thereby providing the bank with the funds to pay the "interest" on the equity-indexed certificates of deposit.  During the term of the separate freestanding equity derivative contracts, the bank will periodically make either fixed or variable payments to the counterparty on these contracts.

When a bank issues an equity-indexed certificate of deposit, it must either account for the written equity call option embedded in the deposit separately from the certificate of deposit host contract or irrevocably elect to account for the hybrid instrument (the equity-indexed certificate of deposit) in its entirety at fair value.

* If the bank accounts for the written equity call option separately from the certificate of deposit, the fair value of this embedded derivative on the date the certificate of deposit is issued must be deducted from the amount the purchaser invested in the deposit, creating a discount on the certificate of deposit that must be amortized to interest expense over the term of the deposit using the effective interest method.  This interest expense should be reported in the income statement in the appropriate subitem of Schedule RI, item 2.a, "Interest on deposits."  The equity call option must be "marked to market" at least quarterly with any changes in the fair value of the option recognized in earnings.  On the balance sheet, the carrying value of the certificate of deposit host contract and the fair value of the embedded equity derivative may be combined and reported together as a deposit liability on the balance sheet (Schedule RC) and in the deposit schedule (Schedule RC-E).

* If the bank elects to account for the equity-indexed certificate of deposit in its entirety at fair value, no discount is to be recorded on the certificate of deposit.  Rather, the equity-indexed certificate of deposit must be "marked to market" at least quarterly, with changes in the instrument's fair value reported in the income statement consistently in either item 5.l, "Other noninterest income," or item 7.d, "Other noninterest expense", excluding interest expense incurred that is reported in the appropriate subitem of Schedule RI, item 2.a, "Interest on deposits."

As for the separate freestanding derivative contracts the bank enters into to manage its market risk, these derivatives must be carried on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value and "marked to market" at least quarterly with changes in their fair value recognized in earnings.  The fair value of the freestanding derivatives should not be netted against the fair value of the embedded equity derivatives for balance sheet purposes because these two derivatives have different counterparties.  The periodic payments to the counterparty on these freestanding derivatives must be accrued with the expense reported in earnings along with the change in the derivative's fair value.  In the income statement (Schedule RI), the changes in the fair value of the embedded and freestanding derivatives, including the effect of the accruals for the payments to the counterparty on the freestanding derivatives, should be netted and reported consistently in either item 5.l, "Other noninterest income," or item 7.d, "Other noninterest expense."

Unless the bank elects to account for the equity-indexed certificate of deposit in its entirety at fair value, the notional amount of the embedded equity call option must be reported in Schedule RC L, item 12.d.(1), column C, and item 14, column C, and its fair value (which will always be negative or zero, but not positive) must be reported in Schedule RC-L, item 15.b.(2), column C.  The notional amount of the freestanding equity derivative must be reported in the appropriate subitem of Schedule RC-L, item 12, column C (e.g., item 12.e, column C, if it is an equity swap), and in Schedule RC-L, item 14, column C.  The fair value of the freestanding equity derivative must be included in the appropriate subitem of Schedule RC-L, item 15.b, column C.  The equity derivative embedded in the equity-indexed certificate of deposit is a written option, which is not covered by the agencies' risk-based capital standards.  However, the freestanding equity derivative is covered by these standards.

For deposit insurance assessment purposes, if the carrying value of the certificate of deposit host contract and the fair value of the embedded equity derivative are combined and reported together as a deposit liability on the balance sheet, the difference between these combined amounts and the face amount of the certificate of deposit should be treated as an unamortized premium or discount, as appropriate, for purposes of reporting total deposit liabilities in Schedule RC-O, item 1.  If these two amounts are not combined and only the carrying value of the certificate of deposit host contract is reported as a deposit liability on the balance sheet, the difference between the carrying value and the face amount of the certificate of deposit should be treated as an unamortized discount in Schedule RC-O, item 1.  If the bank elects to account for the equity-indexed certificate of deposit in its entirety at fair value, the difference between the fair value and the face amount of the certificate of deposit should be treated as an unamortized premium or discount, as appropriate, in Schedule RC-O, item 1.

A bank that purchases an equity-indexed certificate of deposit for investment purposes must either account for the embedded purchased equity call option separately from the certificate of deposit host contract or irrevocably elect to account for the hybrid instrument (the equity-indexed certificate of deposit) in its entirety at fair value.

* If the bank accounts for the purchased equity call option separately from the certificate of deposit, the fair value of this embedded derivative on the date of purchase must be deducted from the purchase price of the certificate, creating a discount on the deposit that must be accreted into income over the term of the deposit using the effective interest method.  This accretion should be reported in the income statement in Schedule RI, item 1.c.  The embedded equity derivative must be "marked to market" at least quarterly with any changes in its fair value recognized in earnings.  These fair value changes should be reported consistently in Schedule RI in either item 5.l, "Other noninterest income," or item 7.d, "Other noninterest expense."  The carrying value of the certificate of deposit host contract and the fair value of the embedded equity derivative may be combined and reported together as interest-bearing balances due from other depository institutions on the balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 1.b.

* If the bank elects to account for the equity-indexed certificate of deposit in its entirety at fair value, no discount is to be recorded on the certificate of deposit.  Rather, the equity-indexed certificate of deposit must be "marked to market" at least quarterly, with changes in the instrument's fair value reported in the income statement consistently in either item 5.l, "Other noninterest income," or item 7.d, "Other noninterest expense," excluding interest income that is reported in Schedule RI, item 1.c.

Unless the bank elects to account for the equity-indexed certificate of deposit in its entirety at fair value, the notional amount of the embedded derivative must be reported in Schedule RC-L, item 12.d.(2), column C, and item 14, column C, and its fair value (which will always be positive or zero, but not negative) must be reported in Schedule RC-L, item 15.b.(1), column C. The embedded equity derivative in the equity-indexed certificate of deposit is a purchased option, which is subject to the agencies' risk-based capital standards unless the fair value election has been made.</label>

A summary of the relevant sections of these accounting standards follows.  For further information, see ASC Subtopic 860-50, ASC Topic 948, and the Glossary entry for "transfers of financial assets." 

Servicing of mortgage loans, credit card receivables, or other financial assets includes, but is not limited to, collecting principal, interest, and escrow payments from borrowers; paying taxes and insurance from escrowed funds; monitoring delinquencies; executing foreclosure if necessary; temporarily investing funds pending distribution; remitting fees to guarantors, trustees, and others providing services; and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to the holders of beneficial interests in the financial assets.  Servicers typically receive certain benefits from the servicing contract and incur the costs of servicing the assets.

Servicing is inherent in all financial assets; it becomes a distinct asset or liability for accounting purposes only in certain circumstances as discussed below.  Servicing assets result from contracts to service financial assets under which the benefits of servicing (estimated future revenues from contractually specified servicing fees, late charges, and other ancillary sources) are expected to more than adequately compensate the servicer for performing the servicing.  Servicing liabilities result from contracts to service financial assets under which the benefits of servicing are not expected to adequately compensate the servicer for performing the servicing.  Contractually specified servicing fees are all amounts that, per contract, are due to the servicer in exchange for servicing the financial asset and would no longer be received by a servicer if the beneficial owners of the serviced assets or their trustees or agents were to exercise their actual or potential authority under the contract to shift the servicing to another servicer.  Adequate compensation is the amount of benefits of servicing that would fairly compensate a substitute servicer should one be required including the profit that would be demanded by a substitute servicer in the marketplace.

A bank must recognize and initially measure at fair value a servicing asset or a servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in either of the following situations:

(1) The bank's transfer of an entire financial asset, a group of entire financial assets, or a participating interest in an entire financial asset that meets the requirements for sale accounting; or

(2) An acquisition or assumption of a servicing obligation that does not relate to financial assets of the bank or its consolidated affiliates included in the Reports of Condition and Income being presented.

If a bank sells a participating interest in an entire financial asset, it only recognizes a servicing asset or servicing liability related to the participating interest sold.  

A bank that transfers its financial assets to an unconsolidated entity in a transfer that qualifies as a sale in which the bank obtains the resulting securities and classifies them as debt securities held-to-maturity in accordance with ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities (formerly FASB Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities"), may either separately recognize its servicing assets or servicing liabilities or report those servicing assets or servicing liabilities together with the assets being serviced.

A bank should account for its servicing contract that qualifies for separate recognition as a servicing asset or servicing liability initially measured at fair value regardless of whether explicit consideration was exchanged.  A bank that transfers or securitizes financial assets in a transaction that does not meet the requirements for sale accounting under ASC Topic 860 and is accounted for as a secured borrowing with the underlying assets remaining on the bank's balance sheet must not recognize a servicing asset or a servicing liability.  

After initially measuring a servicing asset or servicing liability at fair value, a bank should subsequently measure each class of servicing assets and servicing liabilities using either the amortization method or the fair value measurement method.  The election of the subsequent measurement method should be made separately for each class of servicing assets and servicing liabilities.  A bank must apply the same subsequent measurement method to each servicing asset and servicing liability in a class.  Each bank should identify its classes of servicing assets and servicing liabilities based on (a) the availability of market inputs used in determining the fair value of servicing assets and servicing liabilities, (b) the bank's method for managing the risks of its servicing assets or servicing liabilities, or (c) both.  Different elections can be made for different classes of servicing.  For a class of servicing assets and servicing liabilities that is subsequently measured using the amortization method, a bank may change the subsequent measurement method for that class of servicing by making an irrevocable decision to elect the fair value measurement method for that class at the beginning of any fiscal year.  Once a bank elects the fair value measurement method for a class of servicing, that election must not be reversed.   

Under the amortization method, all servicing assets or servicing liabilities in the class should be amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income for assets (servicing revenues in excess of servicing costs) or net servicing loss for liabilities (servicing costs in excess of servicing revenues).  The servicing assets or servicing liabilities should be assessed for impairment or increased obligation based on fair value at each quarter-end report date.  The servicing assets within a class should be stratified into groups based on one or more of the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying financial assets.  If the carrying amount of a stratum of servicing assets exceeds its fair value, the bank should separately recognize impairment for that stratum by reducing the carrying amount to fair value through a valuation allowance for that stratum.  The valuation allowance should be adjusted to reflect changes in the measurement of impairment subsequent to the initial measurement of impairment.  For the servicing liabilities within a class, if subsequent events have increased the fair value of the liability above the carrying amount of the servicing liabilities, the bank should recognize the increased obligation as a loss in current earnings.  

Under the fair value measurement method, all servicing assets or servicing liabilities in a class should be measured at fair value at each quarter-end report date.  Changes in the fair value of these servicing assets and servicing liabilities should be reported in earnings in the period in which the changes occur.  

For purposes of these reports, servicing assets resulting from contracts to service loans secured by real estate (as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1, in the Glossary entry for "Loans secured by real estate") should be reported in Schedule RC-M, item 2.a, "Mortgage servicing assets."  Servicing assets resulting from contracts to service all other financial assets should be reported in Schedule RC-M, item 2.b, "Purchased credit card relationships and nonmortgage servicing assets."  When reporting the carrying amount of mortgage servicing assets in Schedule RC-M, item 2.a, and nonmortgage servicing assets in Schedule RC-M, item 2.b, banks should include all classes of servicing accounted for under the amortization method as well as all classes of servicing accounted for under the fair value measurement method.  The fair value of all recognized mortgage servicing assets should be reported in Schedule RC-M, item 2.a.(1), regardless of the subsequent measurement method applied to these assets.  The amount of mortgage servicing assets reported in Schedule RC M, item 2.a, should be used when determining the amount of such assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities, that exceed the 10 and 15 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction thresholds in Schedule RC-R, Part I.  Changes in the fair value of any class of servicing assets and servicing liabilities accounted for under the fair value measurement method should be included in earnings in Schedule RI, item 5.f, "Net servicing fees."  In addition, certain information about assets serviced by the reporting bank should be reported in Schedule RC-S, Servicing, Securitization, and Asset Sale Activities.</label>

A summary of this accounting guidance follows.  For further information, see AICPA Statement of Position 98-5.

Start-up activities are defined broadly as those one-time activities related to opening a new facility, introducing a new product or service, conducting business in a new territory, conducting business with a new class of customer, or commencing some new operation.  Start-up activities include activities related to organizing a new entity, such as a new bank, the costs of which are commonly referred to as organization costs.[1]

Costs of start-up activities, including organization costs, should be expensed as incurred.  Costs of acquiring or constructing premises and fixed assets and getting them ready for their intded use are not start-up costs, but the costs of using such assets that are allocated to start-up activities (e.g., depreciation of computers) are considered start-up costs.

For a new bank, pre-opening expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, rent, depreciation, supplies, directors' fees, training, travel, postage, and telephone are considered start-up costs.  Pre-opening income earned and expenses incurred from the bank's inception until the date the bank commences operations should be reported in the Report of Income using one of the two following methods, consistent with the manner in which the bank reports pre-opening income and expenses for other financial reporting purposes:

(1) Pre-opening income and expenses for the entire period from the bank's inception until the date the bank commences operations should be reported in the appropriate items of Schedule RI, Income Statement, each quarter during the calendar year in which operations commence; or

(2) Pre-opening income and expenses for the period from the bank's inception until the beginning of the calendar year in which the bank commences operations should be included, along with the bank's opening (original) equity capital, in Schedule RI-A, item 5, "Sale, conversion, acquisition, or retirement of capital stock, net."  The net amount of these pre-opening income and expenses should be identified and described in Schedule RI-E, item 7.  Pre-opening income earned and expenses incurred during the calendar year in which the bank commences operations should be reported in the appropriate items of Schedule RI, Income Statement, each quarter during the calendar year in which operations commence.

The organization costs of forming a holding company and the costs of other holding company start-up activities are sometimes paid by the bank that will be owned by the holding company.  Because these are the holding company's costs, whether or not the holding company formation is successful, they should not be reported as expenses of the bank.  Accordingly, any unreimbursed costs paid by the bank on behalf of the holding company should be reported as a cash dividend to the holding company in Schedule RI-A, item 9.  In addition, if a new bank and holding company are being formed at the same time, the costs of the bank's start-up activities, including its organization costs, should be reported as start-up costs for the bank.  If the holding company pays these costs for the bank but is not reimbursed by the bank, the bank should treat the holding company's forgiveness of payment as a capital contribution, which should be reported in Schedule RI-A, item 11, "Other transactions with parent holding company," and in Schedule RI-E, item 5.



[1]  Organization costs for a bank are the direct costs incurred to incorporate and charter the bank.  Such costs include, but are not limited to, professional (e.g., legal, accounting, and consulting) fees and printing costs directly related to the chartering or incorporation process, filing fees paid to chartering authorities, and the cost of economic impact studies.</label>

A majority-owned subsidiary of the reporting bank is a subsidiary in which the parent bank directly or indirectly owns more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting stock.

A significant subsidiary of the reporting bank is a majority-owned subsidiary that meets any one or more of the following tests:


(1)	The bank's direct and indirect investment in and advances to the subsidiary equals five percent or more of the total equity capital of the parent bank.

NOTE:  For the purposes of this test, the amount of direct and indirect investments and advances is either (a) the amount carried on the books of the parent bank or (b) the parent's proportionate share in the total equity capital of the subsidiary, whichever is greater.

(2)	The parent bank's proportional share (based on equity ownership) of the subsidiary's gross operating income or revenue amounts to five percent or more of the gross operating income or revenue of the consolidated parent bank.

(3)	The subsidiary's income or loss before income taxes amounts to five percent or more of the parent bank's income or loss before income taxes.

(4)	The subsidiary is, in turn, the parent of one or more subsidiaries which, when consolidated with the subsidiary, constitute a significant subsidiary as defined in one or more of the above tests.

An associated company is a corporation in which the bank, directly or indirectly, owns 20 to 50 percent of the outstanding voting stock and over which the bank exercises significant influence.  This 20 to 50 percent ownership is presumed to carry "significant" influence unless the bank can demonstrate the contrary to the satisfaction of the appropriate federal supervisory authority.

A corporate joint venture is a corporation owned and operated by a group of banks or other businesses ("joint venturers"), no one of which has a majority interest, as a separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the joint venturers.  Each joint venturer may participate, directly or indirectly, in the management of the joint venture.  An entity that is a majority-owned subsidiary of one of the joint venturers is not a corporate joint venture.

The equity ownership in majority owned subsidiaries that are not consolidated on the Reports of Condition and Income (in accordance with the guidance in the General Instructions on the Scope of the "Consolidated Bank" Required to be Reported in the Submitted Reports) and in associated companies is accounted for using the equity method of accounting and is reported in Schedule RC M, item 4, and in Schedule RC, item 8, "Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and associated companies."


Ownership in a corporate joint venture is to be treated in the same manner as an associated company (defined above) only to the extent that the equity share represents significant influence over management.  Otherwise, equity holdings in a joint venture are treated as holdings of corporate stock and income is recognized only when distributed in the form of dividends.

Banks are permitted to offset assets and liabilities recognized in the Report of Condition when a "right of setoff" exists.  Under FASB Interpretation No. 39, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts," a right of setoff exists when all of the following conditions are met:

(1) Each of two parties owes the other determinable amounts.  Thus, only bilateral netting is permitted.

(2) The reporting party has the right to set off the amount owed with the amount owed by the other party.

(3) The reporting party intends to set off.  This condition does not have to be met for fair value amounts recognized for conditional or exchange contracts that have been executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement.

(4) The right of setoff is enforceable at law.  Legal constraints should be considered to determine whether the right of setoff is enforceable.  Accordingly, the right of setoff should be upheld in bankruptcy (or receivership).  Offsetting is appropriate only if the available evidence, both positive and negative, indicates that there is reasonable assurance that the right of setoff would be upheld in bankruptcy (or receivership).

According to Interpretation No. 39, for forward, interest rate swap, currency swap, option, and other conditional and exchange contracts, a master netting arrangement exists if the reporting bank has multiple contracts, whether for the same type of conditional or exchange contract or for different types of contracts, with a single counterparty that are subject to a contractual agreement that provides for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment in a single currency in the event of default or termination of any one contract.

Offsetting the assets and liabilities recognized for conditional or exchange contracts outstanding with a single counterparty results in the net position between the two counterparties being reported as an asset or a liability in the Report of Condition.  The reporting entity's choice to offset or not to offset assets and liabilities recognized for conditional or exchange contracts must be applied consistently.  

Offsetting of assets and liabilities is also permitted by other accounting pronouncements identified in Interpretation No. 39.  These pronouncements apply to such items as leveraged leases, pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets and liabilities, and deferred tax assets and liabilities.  In addition, FASB Interpretation No. 41, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements," describes the circumstances in which amounts recognized as payables under repurchase agreements may be offset against amounts recognized as receivables under reverse repurchase agreements and reported as a net amount in the balance sheet.  The reporting entity's choice to offset or not to offset payables and receivables under Interpretation No. 41 must be applied consistently.

According to the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Depository and Lending Institutions, FASB Interpretation No. 41 does not apply to securities borrowing or lending transactions.  Therefore, for purposes of the Report of Condition, banks should not offset securities borrowing and lending transactions in the balance sheet unless all the conditions set forth in Interpretation No. 39 are met.

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-line-770970_lbl_272" xml:lang="en">Changes in accounting principles - The accounting principles that banks have adopted for the preparation of their Reports of Condition and Income should be changed only if (a) the change is required by a newly issued accounting pronouncement or (b) the bank can justify the use of an allowable alternative accounting principle on the basis that it is preferable when there are two or more generally accepted accounting principles for a type of event or transaction.  If a bank changes from the use of one acceptable accounting principle to one that is more preferable at any time during the calendar year, it must report the income or expense item(s) affected by the change for the entire year on the basis of the newly adopted accounting principle regardless of the date when the change is actually made.  However, a change from an accounting principle that is neither accepted nor sanctioned by bank supervisors to one that is acceptable to supervisors is to be reported as a correction of an error as discussed below.

New accounting pronouncements that are adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (or such other body officially designated to establish accounting principles) generally include transition guidance on how to initially apply the pronouncement.  In general, the pronouncements require (or allow) a bank to use one of the following approaches, collectively referred to as "retrospective application":

* apply a different accounting principle to one or more previously issued financial statements; or

* make a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, assets, and/or liabilities at the beginning of the period as if that principle had always been used.

Because each Report of Income covers a single discrete period, only the second approach under retrospective application is permitted in the Reports of Condition and Income.  Therefore, when an accounting pronouncement requires the application of either of the approaches under retrospective application, banks must report the effect on the amount of retained earnings at the beginning of the year in which the new pronouncement is first adopted for purposes of the Reports of Condition and Income (net of applicable income taxes, if any) as a direct adjustment to equity capital in Schedule RI-A, item 2, and describe the adjustment in Schedule RI-E, item 4.

In the Reports of Condition and Income in which a change in accounting principle is first reflected, the bank is encouraged to include an explanation of the nature and reason for the change in accounting principle in Schedule RI-E, item 7, "Other explanations," or in the "Optional Narrative Statement Concerning the Amounts Reported in the Reports of Condition and Income."

Changes in accounting estimates - Accounting and the preparation of financial statements involve the use of estimates.  As more current information becomes known, estimates may be changed.  In particular, accruals are derived from estimates based on judgments about the outcome of future events and changes in these estimates are an inherent part of accrual accounting.

Reasonable changes in accounting estimates do not require the restatement of amounts of income and expenses and assets, liabilities, and capital reported in previously submitted Reports of Condition and Income.  Computation of the cumulative effect of these changes is also not ordinarily necessary.  Rather, the effect of such changes is handled on a prospective basis.  That is, beginning in the period when an accounting estimate is revised, the related item of income or expense for that period is adjusted accordingly.  For example, if the bank's estimate of the remaining useful life of certain bank equipment is increased, the remaining undepreciated cost of the equipment would be spread over its revised remaining useful life.  Similarly, immaterial accrual adjustments to items of income and expenses, including provisions for loan and lease losses and income taxes, are considered changes in accounting estimates and would be taken into account by adjusting the affected income and expense accounts for the year in which the adjustments were found to be appropriate.

However, large and unusual changes in accounting estimates may be more properly treated as constituting accounting errors, and if so, must be reported accordingly as described below.

Corrections of accounting errors - A bank may become aware of an error in a Report of Condition or Report of Income after it has been submitted to the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency through either its own or its regulator's discovery of the error.  An error in the recognition, measurement, or presentation of an event or transaction included in a report for a prior period may result from:

* a mathematical mistake;
* a mistake in applying accounting principles; or
* the oversight or misuse of facts that existed when the Reports of Condition and Income for prior periods were prepared.

According to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), the effects of prior year errors or misstatements ("carryover effects") should be considered when quantifying misstatements identified in current year financial statements.  SAB 108 describes two methods for accumulating and quantifying misstatements.  These methods are referred to as the "rollover" and "iron curtain" approaches:    

* The rollover approach "quantifies a misstatement based on the amount of the error originating in the current year income statement" only and ignores the "carryover effects" of any related prior year misstatements.  The primary weakness of the rollover approach is that it fails to consider the effects of correcting the portion of the current year balance sheet misstatement that originated in prior years. 

* The iron curtain approach "quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year, irrespective of the misstatement's year(s) of origination."  The primary weakness of the iron curtain approach is that it does not consider the correction of prior year misstatements in the current year financial statements to be errors because the prior year misstatements were considered immaterial in the year(s) of origination.  Thus, there could be a material misstatement in the current year income statement because the correction of the accumulated immaterial amounts from prior years is not evaluated as an error.

Because of the weaknesses in these two approaches, SAB 108 states that the impact of correcting all misstatements on current year financial statements should be accomplished by quantifying an error under both the rollover and iron curtain approaches and by evaluating the error measured under each approach.  When either approach results in a misstatement that is material, after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, an adjustment to the financial statements would be required.  Guidance on the consideration of all relevant factors when assessing the materiality of misstatements is provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materiality (SAB 99) (codified as Topic 1.M. in the Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins).

For purposes of the Reports of Condition and Income, all banks should follow the sound accounting practices described in SAB 108 and SAB 99.  Accordingly, banks should quantify the impact of correcting misstatements, including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements, on their current year reports by applying both the "rollover" and "iron curtain" approaches and evaluating the impact of the error measured under each approach.  When the misstatement that exists after recording the adjustment in the current year Reports of Condition and Income is material (considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors), the appropriate prior year report(s) should be amended, even though such revision previously was and continues to be immaterial to the prior year report(s).  If the misstatement that exists after recording the adjustment in the current year Reports of Condition and Income is not material, then amending the immaterial errors in prior year reports would not be necessary.

When a bank's primary federal bank regulatory agency determines that the bank's Reports of Condition and Income contain a material accounting error, the bank may be directed to file amended condition and/or income report data for each prior period that was significantly affected by the error.  Normally, such refilings will not result in restatements of reports for periods exceeding five years.  If amended reports are not required, the bank should report the effect of such corrections on retained earnings at the beginning of the year, net of applicable income taxes, in Schedule RI-A, item 2, "Restatements due to corrections of material accounting errors and changes in accounting principles," and in Schedule RI E, item 4.  The effect of such corrections on income and expenses since the beginning of the year in which the error is discovered should be reflected in each affected income and expense account on a year-to-date basis in the next quarterly Report of Income to be filed and not as a direct adjustment to retained earnings.

In addition, a change from an accounting principle that is neither accepted nor sanctioned by bank supervisors to one that is acceptable to supervisors is to be reported as a correction of an error.  When such a change is implemented, the cumulative effect that applies to prior periods, calculated in the same manner as described above for other changes in accounting principles, should be reported in Schedule RI-A, item 2, "Restatements due to corrections of material accounting errors and changes in accounting principles," and in Schedule RI-E, item 4.  In most cases of this kind undertaken voluntarily by the reporting bank in order to adopt more acceptable accounting practices, such a change will not result in a request for amended reports for prior periods unless substantial distortions in the bank's previously reported results are in evidence.

In the Reports of Condition and Income in which the correction of an error is first reflected, the bank is encouraged to include an explanation of the nature and reason for the correction in Schedule RI-E, item 7, "Other explanations," or in the "Optional Narrative Statement Concerning the Amounts Reported in the Reports of Condition and Income."</label>

If a securitization transaction qualifies as a sale under FASB Statement No. 140, the selling institution removes the receivables that were sold from its reported assets and continues to carry any retained interests in the transferred receivables on its balance sheet.   The "accrued interest receivable" (AIR) asset typically consists of the seller's retained interest in the investor's portion of (1) the accrued fees and finance charges that have been billed to customer accounts, but have not yet been collected ("billed but uncollected"), and (2) the right to finance charges that have been accrued on cardholder accounts, but have not yet been billed ("accrued but unbilled").  

While the selling institution retains a right to the excess cash flows generated from the fees and finance charges collected on the transferred receivables, the institution generally subordinates its right to these cash flows to the investors in the securitization.  If and when cash payments on the accrued fees and finance charges are collected, they flow through the trust, where they are available to satisfy more senior obligations before any excess amount is remitted to the seller. Only after trust expenses (such as servicing fees, investor certificate interest, and investor principal charge-offs) have been paid will the trustee distribute any excess fee and finance charge cash flow back to the seller.  Since investors are paid from these cash collections before the selling institution receives the amount of AIR that is due, the seller may or may not realize the full amount of its AIR asset.

Accounting at Inception of the Securitization Transaction -- Generally, if a securitization transaction meets the criteria for sale treatment and the AIR is subordinated either because the asset has been isolated from the transferor[1] or because of the operation of the cash flow distribution (or "waterfall") through the securitization trust, the total AIR asset (both the "billed and uncollected" and "accrued and unbilled") should be considered one of the components of the sale transaction.  Thus, when accounting for a credit card securitization, an institution should allocate the previous carrying amount of the AIR (net of any related allowance for uncollectible amounts) and the other transferred assets between the assets that are sold and the retained interests, based on their relative fair values at the date of transfer. As a result, after a securitization, the allocated carrying amount of the AIR asset will typically be lower than its face amount.  

Subsequent Accounting -- After securitization, the AIR asset should be accounted for at its allocated cost basis (as discussed above).  In addition, an institution should treat the AIR asset as a retained (subordinated) beneficial interest.  Accordingly, it should be reported as an "All other asset" in Schedule RC-F, item 6, and in Schedule RC-S, item 2.b., column C, (if reported as a stand-alone asset) and not as a loan receivable.

Although the AIR asset is a retained beneficial interest in transferred assets, it is not required to be subsequently measured like an investment in debt securities classified as available for sale or trading under FASB Statements Nos. 115 and 140 because the AIR asset cannot be contractually prepaid or settled in such a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment.  Rather, institutions should follow existing applicable accounting standards, including FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, in subsequent accounting for the AIR asset.  Statement No. 5 addresses the accounting for various loss contingencies, including the collectibility of receivables.

For further guidance, banks should refer to the Interagency Advisory on the Accounting Treatment of Accrued Interest Receivable Related to Credit Card Securitizations dated December 4, 2002.  See also the Glossary entry for "Transfers of Financial Assets."

In a syndication, the participants agree to the terms of the participation prior to the execution of the final agreement and the contract is executed by the obligor and by all the participants, although there is usually a lead institution organizing or managing the credit.  Large commercial and industrial loans, large loans to finance companies, and large foreign loans may be handled through such syndicated participations.

Each participant in the syndicate, including the lead bank, records its own share of the participated loan and the total amount of the loan is not entered on the books of one bank to be shared through transfers of loans.  Thus, the initial operation and distribution of this type of participation does not require a determination as to whether a transfer that should be accounted for as a sale has occurred. However, any subsequent transfers of shares, or parts of shares, in the syndicated loan would be subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 140 governing whether these transfers should be accounted for as a sale or a secured borrowing.

Thus, brokered deposits include both those in which the entire beneficial interest in a given bank deposit account or instrument is held by a single depositor and those in which the deposit broker sells participations in a given bank deposit account or instrument to one or more investors.

Fully insured brokered deposits are brokered deposits that are issued in denominations of $100,000 or less or that are issued in denominations greater than $100,000 and participated out by the deposit broker in shares of $100,000 or less.  Fully insured brokered deposits also include brokered deposits that represent retirement deposit accounts (as defined in Schedule RC-O, Memorandum item 1) eligible for $250,000 in deposit insurance coverage that (a) are issued in denominations of more than $100,000 through $250,000 or (b) are shares of more than $100,000 through $250,000 participated out by the deposit broker in brokered deposits issued in denominations greater than $100,000.

For purposes of these reports, the term deposit broker includes:

(1) any person engaged in the business of placing deposits, or facilitating the placement of deposits, of third parties with insured depository institutions or the business of placing deposits with insured depository institutions for the purpose of selling interests in those deposits to third parties, and

(2) an agent or trustee who establishes a deposit account to facilitate a business arrangement with an insured depository institution to use the proceeds of the account to fund a prearranged loan.

The term deposit broker does not include:

(1) an insured depository institution, with respect to funds placed with that depository institution;

(2) an employee of an insured depository institution, with respect to funds placed with the employing depository institution;

(3) a trust department of an insured depository institution, if the trust in question has not been established for the primary purpose of placing funds with insured depository institutions;

(4) the trustee of a pension or other employee benefit plan, with respect to funds of the plan;

(5) a person acting as a plan administrator or an investment adviser in connection with a pension plan or other employee benefit plan provided that that person is performing managerial functions with respect to the plan;

(6) the trustee of a testamentary account;

(7) the trustee of an irrevocable trust (other than a trustee who establishes a deposit account to facilitate a business arrangement with an insured depository institution to use the proceeds of the account to fund a prearranged loan), as long as the trust in question has not been established for the primary purpose of placing funds with insured depository institutions;

(8) a trustee or custodian of a pension or profit-sharing plan qualified under Section 401(d) or 430(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or

(9) an agent or nominee whose primary purpose is not the placement of funds with depository institutions.  (For purposes of applying this ninth exclusion from the definition of deposit broker, "primary purpose" does not mean "primary activity," but should be construed as "primary intent.")

Notwithstanding these nine exclusions, the term deposit broker (as amended on September 23, 1994, by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994) includes any insured depository institution that is not well capitalized (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, Prompt Corrective Action), and any employee of such institution, which engages, directly or indirectly, in the solicitation of deposits by offering rates of interest which are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on deposits offered by other insured depository institutions in such depository institution's normal market area.[1]  For purposes of these reports, only those deposits accepted, renewed, or rolled over on or after June 16, 1992, in connection with this form of deposit solicitation are to be reported as brokered deposits.  For further information, see Section 337.6(b) of the FDIC's Rules and Regulations.

In addition, deposit instruments of the reporting bank that are sold to brokers, dealers, or underwriters (including both bank affiliates of the reporting bank and nonbank subsidiaries of the reporting bank's parent holding company) who then reoffer and/or resell these deposit instruments to one or more investors, regardless of the minimum denomination which the investor must purchase, are considered brokered deposits.

In some cases, brokered deposits are issued in the name of the depositor whose funds have been placed in a bank by a deposit broker.  In other cases, a bank's deposit account records may indicate that the funds have been deposited in the name of a third party custodian for the benefit of others (e.g., "XYZ Corporation as custodian for the benefit of others," or "Custodial account of XYZ Corporation").  Unless the custodian meets one of the specific exemptions from the "deposit broker" definition in Section 29 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and this Glossary entry, these custodial accounts should be reported as brokered deposits in Schedule RC-E, Deposit Liabilities.

A deposit listing service whose only function is to provide information on the availability and terms of accounts is not facilitating the placement of deposits and therefore is not a deposit broker per se.  However, if a deposit broker uses a deposit listing service to identify an institution offering a high rate on deposits and then places its customers' funds at that institution, the deposits would be brokered deposits and the institution should report them as such in Schedule RC-E.  The designation of these deposits as brokered deposits is based not on the broker's use of the listing service but on the placement of the deposits in the institution by the deposit broker.


[1]  Any deposit accepted, renewed, or rolled over by a well capitalized institution before September 23, 1994, in connection with this form of deposit solicitation should continue to be reported as a brokered deposit as long as the deposit remains outstanding under the terms in effect before September 23, 1994.  Notwithstanding the amendment to the "deposit broker" definition, all institutions that obtain deposits, directly or indirectly, by or through any other deposit broker must report such funds as brokered deposits in the Report of Condition.</label>

The definitions in these two legal sources differ in certain respects.  Furthermore, for purposes of these reports, the reporting standards for deposits specified in these instructions do not strictly follow the precise legal definitions in these two sources.  The definitions of deposits to be reported in the deposit items of the Reports of Condition and Income are discussed below under the following headings:

(I)	FDI Act definition of deposits.
(II)	Transaction-nontransaction deposit distinction.
(III)	Interest-bearing-noninterest-bearing deposit distinction.

(I)	FDI Act definition of deposits - Section 3(l) states that the term "deposit" means -

	(1)  the unpaid balance of money or its equivalent received or held by a bank or savings association in the usual course of business and for which it has given or is obligated to give credit, either conditionally or unconditionally, to a commercial, checking, savings, time, or thrift account, or which is evidenced by its certificate of deposit, thrift certificate, investment certificate, certificate of indebtedness, or other similar name, or a check or draft drawn against a deposit account and certified by the bank or savings association, or a letter of credit or a traveler's check on which the bank or savings association is primarily liable:  Provided, That, without limiting the generality of the term "money or its equivalent", any such account or instrument must be regarded as evidencing the receipt of the equivalent of money when credited or issued in exchange for checks or drafts or for a promissory note upon which the person obtaining any such credit or instrument is primarily or secondarily liable, or for a charge against a deposit account, or in settlement of checks, drafts, or other instruments forwarded to such bank or savings association for collection,

	(2)  trust funds as defined in this Act received or held by such bank or savings association, whether held in the trust department or held or deposited in any other department of such bank or savings association,

	(3)  money received or held by a bank or savings association, or the credit given for money or its equivalent received or held by a bank or savings association, in the usual course of business for a special or specific purpose, regardless of the legal relationship thereby established, including without being limited to, escrow funds, funds held as security for an obligation due to the bank or savings association or others (including funds held as dealers reserves) or for securities loaned by the bank or savings association, funds deposited by a debtor to meet maturing obligations, funds deposited as advance payment on subscriptions to United States Government securities, funds held for distribution or purchase of securities, funds held to meet its acceptances or letters of credit, and withheld taxes:  Provided, That there shall not be included funds which are received by the bank or savings association for immediate application to the reduction of an indebtedness to the receiving bank or savings association, or under condition that the receipt thereof immediately reduces or extinguishes such an indebtedness,

	(4)  outstanding draft (including advice or authorization to charge a bank's or a savings association's balance in another bank or savings association), cashier's check, money order, or other officer's check issued in the usual course of business for any purpose, including without being limited to those issued in payment for services, dividends, or purchases, and

	(5)  such other obligations of a bank or savings association as the Board of Directors, after consultation with the Comptroller of the Currency, Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, shall find and prescribe by regulation to be deposit liabilities by general usage, except that the following shall not be a deposit for any of the purposes of this Act or be included as part of the total deposits or of an insured deposit:

		(A)  any obligation of a depository institution which is carried on the books and records of an office of such bank or savings association located outside of any State, unless -

			(i)  such obligation would be a deposit if it were carried on the books and records of the depository institution, and would be payable at, an office located in any State; and

			(ii)  the contract evidencing the obligation provides by express terms, and not by implication, for payment at an office of the depository institution located in any State; and

		(B)  any international banking facility deposit, including an international banking facility time deposit, as such term is from time to time defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in regulation D or any successor regulation issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; and

		(C)  any liability of an insured depository institution that arises under an annuity contract, the income of which is tax deferred under section 72 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(II)  Transaction-nontransaction deposit distinction:  The Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the current Federal Reserve Regulation D, "Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions," establish, for purposes of federal reserve requirements on deposit liabilities, a category of deposits designated as "transaction accounts."  All deposits that are not transaction accounts are "nontransaction accounts."

	(1)  Transaction accounts - With the exceptions noted below, a "transaction account," as defined in Regulation D and in these instructions, is a deposit or account from which the depositor or account holder is permitted to make transfers or withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instruments, payment orders of withdrawal, telephone transfers, or other similar devices for the purpose of making payments or transfers to third persons or others or from which the depositor may make third party payments at an automated teller machine (ATM), a remote service unit (RSU), or another electronic device, including by debit card.

	Excluded from transaction accounts are savings deposits (both money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) and other savings deposits) as defined below in the nontransaction account category, even though such deposits permit some third-party transfers.  However, an account that otherwise meets the definition of a savings deposit but that authorizes or permits the depositor to exceed the transfer limitations specified for that account shall be reported as a transaction account.  (Please refer to the definition of savings deposits for further detail.)

	NOTE:  Under the Federal Reserve's current Regulation D, no transaction account, regardless of its other characteristics, is classified either as a savings deposit or as a time deposit.  Thus, those transaction accounts that are not demand deposits - NOW accounts, ATS (Automatic Transfer Service) accounts, and telephone and preauthorized transfer accounts - are excluded from Regulation D time and savings deposits.  For all items in the Reports of Condition and Income involving time or savings deposits, a strict distinction, based on Regulation D definitions, is to be maintained between transaction accounts and time and savings accounts.

	Transaction accounts consist of the following types of deposits:  (a) demand deposits; (b) NOW accounts; (c) ATS accounts; and (d) telephone and preauthorized transfer accounts, all as defined below.  Interest that is paid by the crediting of transaction accounts is also included in transaction accounts.

		(a)  Demand deposits are noninterest-bearing deposits that are payable immediately on demand, or that are issued with an original maturity or required notice period of less than seven days, or that represent funds for which the depository institution does not reserve the right to require at least seven days' written notice of an intended withdrawal. Demand deposits include any matured time deposits without automatic renewal provisions, unless the deposit agreement provides for the funds to be transferred at maturity to another type of account.  Demand deposits do not include:  (i) money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) or (ii) NOW accounts, as defined below in this entry.

		(b)  NOW accounts are interest-bearing deposits (i) on which the depository institution has reserved the right to require at least seven days' written notice prior to withdrawal or transfer of any funds in the account and (ii) that can be withdrawn or transferred to third parties by issuance of a negotiable or transferable instrument.

		NOW accounts, as authorized by federal law, are limited to accounts held by:

			(i)  Individuals or sole proprietorships;

			(ii)  Organizations that are operated primarily for religious, philanthropic, charitable, educational, or other similar purposes and that are not operated for profit.  These include organizations, partnerships, corporations, or associations that are not organized for profit and are described in section 501(c)(3) through (13) and (19) and section 528 of the Internal Revenue Code, such as church organizations; professional associations; trade associations; labor unions; fraternities, sororities and similar social organizations; and nonprofit recreational clubs; or

			(iii)  Governmental units including the federal government and its agencies and instrumentalities; state governments; county and municipal governments and their political subdivisions; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and any territory or possession of the United States and their political subdivisions.

			Also included are the balances of all NOW accounts of certain other nonprofit organizations that may not fall within the above description but that had established NOW accounts with the reporting institution prior to September 1, 1981. 

			NOTE:  There are no regulatory requirements with respect to minimum balances to be maintained in a NOW account or to the amount of interest that may be paid on a NOW account.

		(c)  ATS accounts are deposits or accounts of individuals or sole proprietorships on which the depository institution has reserved the right to require at least seven days' written notice prior to withdrawal or transfer of any funds in the account and from which, pursuant to written agreement arranged in advance between the reporting institution and the depositor, withdrawals may be made automatically through payment to the depository institution itself or through transfer of credit to a demand deposit or other account in order to cover checks or drafts drawn upon the institution or to maintain a specified balance in, or to make periodic transfers to, such other accounts.

		Some institutions may have entered into agreements with their customers providing that in the event the customer should overdraw a demand deposit (checking) or NOW account, the institution will transfer from that customer's savings account an amount sufficient to cover the overdraft.  The availability of the overdraft protection plan would not in and of itself require that such a savings account be regarded as a transaction account provided that the overall transfer and withdrawal restrictions of a savings deposit are not exceeded.  Please refer to the definition of savings deposit for further detail.

		(d)  Telephone or preauthorized transfer accounts consist of deposits or accounts, other than savings deposits, (1) in which the entire beneficial interest is held by a party eligible to hold a NOW account, (2) on which the reporting institution has reserved the right to require at least seven days' written notice prior to withdrawal or transfer of any funds in the account, and (3) under the terms of which, or by practice of the reporting institution, the depositor is permitted or authorized to make more than six withdrawals per month or statement cycle (or similar period) of at least four weeks for purposes of transferring funds to another account of the depositor at the same institution (including a transaction account) or for making payment to a third party by means of preauthorized transfer, or telephonic (including data transmission) agreement, order or instruction.  An account that permits or authorizes more than six such withdrawals in a "month" (a calendar month or any period approximating a month that is at least four weeks long, such as a statement cycle) is a transaction account whether or not more than six such withdrawals actually are made in the "month." 

		A "preauthorized transfer" includes any arrangement by the reporting institution to pay a third party from the account of a depositor (1) upon written or oral instruction (including an order received through an automated clearing house (ACH)), or (2) at a predetermined time or on a fixed schedule.

		Telephone and preauthorized transfer accounts also include:

			(i)  Deposits or accounts maintained in connection with an arrangement that permits the depositor to obtain credit directly or indirectly through the drawing of a negotiable or nonnegotiable check, draft, order or instruction or other similar device (including telephone or electronic order or instruction) on the issuing institution that can be used for the purpose of making payments or transfers to third parties or others, or to another deposit account of the depositor.

			(ii)  The balance of deposits or accounts that otherwise meet the definition of time deposits, but from which payments may be made to third parties by means of a debit card, an automated teller machine, remote service unit or other electronic device, regardless of the number of payments made.

		However, an account is not a transaction account merely by virtue of arrangements that permit the following types of transfers or withdrawals, regardless of the number:

			(i)  Transfers for the purpose of repaying loans and associated expenses at the same depository institution (as originator or servicer).

			(ii)  Transfers of funds from this account to another account of the same depositor at the same depository institution when made by mail, messenger, automated teller machine, or in person.

			(iii)  Withdrawals for payment directly to the depositor when made by mail, messenger, automated teller machine, in person, or by telephone (via check mailed to the depositor).

	(2)  Nontransaction accounts - All deposits that are not transaction accounts (as defined above) are nontransaction accounts.  Nontransaction accounts include:  (a) savings deposits ((i) money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) and (ii) other savings deposits) and (b) time deposits ((i) time certificates of deposit and (ii) time deposits, open account).  Regulation D no longer distinguishes between money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) and other savings deposits.  However, these two types of accounts are defined below for purposes of these reports, which call for separate data on each in Schedule RC-E, (part I,) Memorandum items 2.a.(1) and (2).

	NOTE:  Under the Federal Reserve's current Regulation D, no transaction accounts, regardless of other characteristics, are defined as savings or time deposits.  Thus, savings deposits as defined here, under the heading nontransaction accounts, constitute the entire savings deposit category.  Likewise, time deposits, also defined here under nontransaction accounts, constitute the entire time deposits category.  

		(a)  Savings deposits are deposits with respect to which the depositor is not required by the deposit contract but may at any time be required by the depository institution to give written notice of an intended withdrawal not less than seven days before withdrawal is made, and that is not payable on a specified date or at the expiration of a specified time after the date of deposit.

		The term savings deposit also means a deposit or account, such as an account commonly known as a passbook savings account, a statement savings account, or a money market deposit account (MMDA), that otherwise meets the requirements of the preceding paragraph and from which, under the terms of the deposit contract or by practice of the depository institution, the depositor is permitted or authorized to make no more than six transfers and withdrawals, or a combination of such transfers and withdrawals, per calendar month or statement cycle (or similar period) of at least four weeks, to another account (including a transaction account) of the depositor at the same institution or to a third party by means of a preauthorized or automatic transfer, or 	telephonic (including data transmission) agreement, order, or instruction, and no more than three of the six such transfers may be made by check, draft, debit card, or similar order made by the depositor and payable to third parties.  telephonic (including data transmission) agreement, order, or instruction, and no more than three of the six such transfers may be made by check, draft, debit card, or similar order made by the depositor and payable to third parties.  Transfers from savings deposits for purposes of covering overdrafts (overdraft protection plans) are included under the withdrawal limits specified for savings deposits.

		There are no regulatory restrictions on the following types of transfers or withdrawals from a savings deposit account, regardless of the number: 

			(1)  Transfers for the purpose of repaying loans and associated expenses at the same depository institution (as originator or servicer). 

			(2)  Transfers of funds from this account to another account of the same depositor at the same institution when made by mail, messenger, automated teller machine, or in person. 

			(3)  Withdrawals for payment directly to the depositor when made by mail, messenger, automated teller machine, in person, or by telephone (via check mailed to the depositor). 

		Further, for a savings deposit account, no minimum balance is required by regulation, there is no regulatory limitation on the amount of interest that may be paid, and no minimum maturity is required (although depository institutions must reserve the right to require at least seven days' written notice prior to withdrawal as stipulated above for a savings deposit).

		Any depository institution may place restrictions and requirements on savings deposits in addition to those stipulated above.  In the case of such further restrictions, the account would still be reported as a savings deposit.

		On the other hand, an account that otherwise meets the definition of a savings deposit but that authorizes or permits the depositor to exceed the six-transfer/withdrawal rule or three-draft rule shall be reported as a transaction account, as follows: 

			(1)  If the depositor is ineligible to hold a NOW account, such an account is considered a demand deposit.

			(2)  If the depositor is eligible to hold a NOW account, the account will be considered either a NOW account, a telephone or preauthorized transfer account, or an ATS account:

				(a)  If withdrawals or transfers by check, draft, or similar instrument are permitted or authorized, the account is considered a NOW account. 

				(b)  If withdrawals or transfers by check, draft, or similar instrument are not permitted or authorized, the account is considered either an ATS account or a telephone or preauthorized transfer account.

		Regulation D no longer distinguishes between money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) and other savings deposits.  However, these two types of accounts are defined as follows for purposes of these reports, which call for separate data on each.

			(1)  Money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) are deposits or accounts that meet the above definition of a savings deposit and that permit up to (but no more than) three of the six allowable transfers to be made by check, draft, debit card or similar order made by the depositor and payable to third parties.

			(2)  Other savings deposits are deposits or accounts that meet the above definition of a savings deposit but that permit no transfers by check, draft, debit card, or similar order made by the depositor and payable to third parties.  Other savings deposits are commonly known as passbook savings or statement savings accounts.

		Examples illustrating distinctions between MMDAs and other savings deposits for purposes of these reports are provided at the end of this Glossary entry.

			(b)  Time deposits are deposits that the depositor does not have a right, and is not permitted, to make withdrawals from within six days after the date of deposit unless the deposit is subject to an early withdrawal penalty of at least seven days' simple interest on amounts withdrawn within the first six days after deposit.  A time deposit from which partial early withdrawals are permitted must impose additional early withdrawal penalties of at least seven days' simple interest on amounts withdrawn within six days after each partial withdrawal.  If such additional early withdrawal penalties are not imposed, the account ceases to be a time deposit.  The account may become a savings deposit if it meets the requirements for a savings deposit; otherwise it becomes a demand deposit.

			NOTE:  The above prescribed penalties are the minimum required by Federal Reserve Regulation D.  Institutions may choose to require penalties for early withdrawal in excess of the regulatory minimums. 

			Time deposits take two forms: 

				(i)  Time certificates of deposit (including rollover certificates of deposit) are deposits evidenced by a negotiable or nonnegotiable instrument, or a deposit in book entry form evidenced by a receipt or similar acknowledgement issued by the bank, that provides, on its face, that the amount of such deposit is payable to the bearer, to any specified person, or to the order of a specified person, as follows: 

					(1)  on a certain date not less than seven days after the date of deposit, 

					(2)  at the expiration of a specified period not less than seven days after the date of the deposit, or 

					(3)  upon written notice to the bank which is to be given not less than seven days before the date of withdrawal. 

				(ii)  Time deposits, open account are deposits (other than time certificates of deposit) for which there is in force a written contract with the depositor that neither the whole nor any part of such deposit may be withdrawn prior to:

					(1)  the date of maturity which shall be not less than seven days after the date of the deposit, or 

					(2)  the expiration of a specified period of written notice of not less than seven days. 

				These deposits include those club accounts, such as Christmas club and vacation club accounts, that are made under written contracts that provide that no withdrawal shall be made until a certain number of periodic deposits has been made during a period of not less than three months, even though some of the deposits are made within six days of the end of such period.

			Time deposits do not include the following categories of liabilities even if they have an original maturity of seven days or more: 

				(1)  Any deposit or account that otherwise meets the definition of a time deposit but that allows withdrawals within the first six days after deposit and that does not require an early withdrawal penalty of at least seven days' simple interest on amounts withdrawn within those first six days.  Such deposits or accounts that meet the definition of a savings deposit shall be reported as savings deposits; otherwise they shall be reported as demand deposits.

				(2)  The remaining balance of a time deposit if a partial early withdrawal is made and the remaining balance is not subject to additional early withdrawal penalties of at least seven days' simple interest on amounts withdrawn within six days after each partial withdrawal.  Such time deposits that meet the definition of a savings deposit shall be reported as savings deposits; otherwise they shall be reported as demand deposits. 

	Reporting of Retail Sweep Arrangements Affecting Transaction and Nontransaction Accounts - In an effort to reduce their reserve requirements, some banks have established "retail sweep arrangements" or "retail sweep programs."  In a retail sweep arrangement, a depository institution transfers funds between a customer's transaction account(s) and that customer's nontransaction account(s) (usually savings deposit account(s)) by means of preauthorized or automatic transfers, typically in order to reduce transaction account reserve requirements while providing the customer with unlimited access to the funds.

	There are three key criteria for retail sweep programs to comply with the Federal Reserve Regulation D definitions of "transaction account" and "savings deposit:"

 		(1)  A depository institution must establish by agreement with its transaction account customer two legally separate accounts: a transaction account (a NOW account or demand deposit account) and a  savings deposit account, including those sometimes called a "money market deposit account" or "MMDA";

		(2)  The swept funds must actually be moved from the customer's transaction account to the customer's savings deposit account on the official books and records of the depository institution as of the close of the business on the day(s) on which the depository institution intends to report the funds in question as savings deposits and not transaction accounts, and vice versa.  In addition to actually moving the customer's funds between accounts and reflecting this movement at the account level:

			(a)  If the depository institution's general ledger is sufficiently disaggregated to distinguish between transaction and savings deposit accounts, the aforementioned movement of funds between the customer's transaction account and savings deposit account must be reflected on the general ledger.
  
			(b)  If the depository institution's general ledger is not sufficiently disaggregated, the distinction may be reflected in supplemental records or systems, but only if such supplemental records or systems constitute official books and records of the institution and are subject to the same prudent managerial oversight and controls as the general ledger.  

			A retail sweep program may not exist solely in records or on systems that do not constitute official books and records of the depository institution and that are not used for any purpose other than generating its Report of Transaction Accounts, Other Deposits and Vault Cash (FR 2900) for submission to the Federal Reserve; and

		(3)  The maximum number of preauthorized or automatic funds transfers ("sweeps") out of a savings deposit account and into a transaction account in a retail sweep program is limited to not more than six per month.  Transfers out of the transaction account and into the savings deposit account may be unlimited in number.

	If any of the three criteria is not met, all swept funds must continue to be reported as transaction accounts, both for purposes of these reports and of FR 2900 deposit reports.  All three criteria must be met in order to report the nontransaction account component of a retail sweep program as a nonreservable savings deposit account.

	Further, for purposes of the Reports of Condition and Income, if all three of the criteria above are met, a bank must report the transaction account and nontransaction account components of a retail sweep program separately when it reports its quarter-end deposit information in Schedules RC, RC-E, and RC-O; its quarterly averages in Schedule RC-K; and its interest expense (if any) in Schedule RI.  Thus, when reporting quarterly averages in Schedule RC-K, a bank should include the amounts held in the transaction account (if interest-bearing) and the nontransaction savings account components of retail sweep arrangements each day or each week in the appropriate separate items for average deposits.  In addition, if the bank pays interest on accounts involved in retail sweep arrangements, the interest expense reported in Schedule RI should be allocated between the transaction account and the nontransaction (savings) account based on the balances in these accounts during the reporting period.

	For additional information, refer to the Federal Reserve Board staff guidance relating to the requirements for a retail sweep program under Regulation D at http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/legalint/FederalReserveAct/2007/20070501/20070501.pdf.

(III)  Interest-bearing-noninterest-bearing deposit distinction:

	(a)  Interest-bearing deposit accounts consist of deposit accounts on which the issuing depository institution pays compensation to the holder for the use of the funds.  Such compensation may be in the form of cash, merchandise, or property or as a credit to an account.  Deposits with a zero percent interest rate that are issued on a discount basis are to be treated as interest-bearing.  Deposit accounts on which the interest rate is periodically adjusted in response to changes in market interest rates and other factors should be reported as interest-bearing even if the rate has been reduced zero, provided the interest rate on these accounts can be increased as market conditions change.

	(b)  Noninterest-bearing deposit accounts consist of deposit accounts on which the issuing depository institution pays no compensation to the holder for the use of the funds.

	Noninterest-bearing deposit accounts include (i) matured time deposits that are not automatically renewable (unless the deposit agreement provides for the funds to be transferred at maturity to another type of account) and (ii) deposits with a zero percent stated interest rate that are issued at face value.

Examples Illustrating Distinctions Between
MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS (MMDAs) and OTHER SAVINGS DEPOSITS


Example 1

A savings deposit account permits no transfers of any type to other accounts or to third parties.
Report this account as an other savings deposit.

Example 2

A savings deposit permits up to six, but no more than six, "preauthorized, automatic, or telephonic" transfers to other accounts or to third parties.  None of the third-party payments may be made by check, draft, or similar order (including debit card). 
Report this account as an other savings deposit.

Example 3

A savings deposit permits no more than six "preauthorized, automatic, or telephonic" transfers to other accounts or to third parties.  Up to three, but no more than three, of the six transfers may be by check, draft, debit card or similar order made by the depositor and payable to third parties. 
Report this account as an MMDA.

Example 4

A savings deposit permits up to three, but no more than three, "preauthorized, automatic, or telephonic" transfers to other accounts or to third parties, any or all which may be by check, draft, debit card or similar order made by the depositor and payable to third parties. 
Report this account as an MMDA.</label>

The accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities are set forth in FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. Statement No. 133 requires all derivatives to be recognized on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities at their fair value.  A summary of the principal provisions of Statement No. 133 follows.  For further information, see Statement No. 133 and the implementation guidance issued by the FASB's Derivatives Implementation Group, which may be found at the FASB's Web site at www.fasb.org.

Statement No. 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.  For purposes of these reports, banks must adopt Statement No. 133 upon the statement's effective date based on their fiscal year, with earlier application permitted consistent with the statement.  Banks are also expected to follow the accounting guidance issued by the Derivatives Implementation Group.

Definition of Derivative

Statement No. 133 defines a "derivative instrument" as a financial instrument or other contract with all three of the following characteristics:

(1) It has one or more underlyings (i.e., specified interest rate, security price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, or other variable) and one or more notional amounts (i.e., number of currency units, shares, bushels, pounds, or other units specified in the contract) or payment provisions or both.  These terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required.

(2) It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have similar response to changes in market factors.

(3) Its terms require or permit net settlement, it can be readily settled net by a means outside the contract, or it provides for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement.

Certain contracts that may meet the definition of a derivative are specifically excluded from the scope of Statement No. 133, including:

* "regular-way" securities trades, which are trades that are completed within the time period generally established by regulations and conventions in the marketplace or by the exchange on which the trade is executed;
* normal purchases and sales of an item other than a financial instrument or derivative instrument
* (e.g., a commodity) that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the reporting entity over a reasonable period in the normal course of business;
* traditional life insurance and property and casualty contracts; and
* certain financial guarantee contracts.

Statement No. 133 has special criteria for determining whether commitments to originate loans meet the definition of a derivative.  Commitments to originate mortgage loans that will be held for sale are accounted for as derivatives.  Commitments to originate mortgage loans that will be held for investment are not accounted for as derivatives.  Also, all commitments to originate loans other than mortgage loans are not accounted for as derivatives.  Commitments to purchase loans must be evaluated to determine whether the commitment meets the definition of a derivative under Statement No. 133.

Types of Derivatives

The most common types of freestanding derivatives are forwards, futures, swaps, options, caps, floors, and collars.

Forward contracts are agreements that obligate two parties to purchase (long) and sell (short) a specific financial instrument, foreign currency, or commodity at a specified price with delivery and settlement at a specified future date.

Futures contracts are standardized forward contracts that are traded on organized exchanges.  Exchanges in the U.S. are registered with and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The deliverable financial instruments underlying interest-rate future contracts are specified investment-grade financial instruments, such as U.S. Treasury securities or mortgage-backed securities.  Foreign currency futures contracts involve specified deliverable amounts of a particular foreign currency.  The deliverable products under commodity futures contracts are specified amounts and grades of commodities such as gold bullion.  Equity futures contracts are derivatives that have a portion of their return linked to the price of a particular equity or to an index of equity prices, such as the Standard and Poor's 500.

Other forward contracts are traded over the counter and their terms are not standardized.  Such contracts can only be terminated, other than by receipt of the underlying asset, by agreement of both buyer and seller.  A forward rate agreement is a forward contract that specifies a reference interest rate and an agreed on interest rate (one to be paid and one to be received), an assumed principal amount (the notional amount), and a specific maturity and settlement date.

Swap contracts are forward-based contracts in which two parties agree to swap streams of payments over a specified period.  The payments are based on an agreed upon notional principal amount. An interest rate swap generally involves no exchange of principal at inception or maturity.  Rather, the notional amount is used to calculate the payment streams to be exchanged.  However, foreign exchange swaps often involve the exchange of principal.

Option contracts (standby contracts) are traded on exchanges and over the counter.  Option contracts grant the right, but do not obligate, the purchaser (holder) to buy (call) or sell (put) a specific or standard commodity, financial, or equity instrument at a specified price during a specified period or at a specified date.  A purchased option is a contract in which the buyer has paid compensation (such as a fee or premium) to acquire the right to sell or purchase an instrument at a stated price on a specified future date.  A written option obligates the option seller to purchase or sell the instrument at the option of the buyer of the contract.  Option contracts may relate to purchases or sales of securities, money market instruments, futures contracts, other financial instruments, or commodities.

Interest rate caps are option contracts in which the cap seller, in return for a premium, agrees to limit the cap holder's risk associated with an increase in interest rates.  If rates go above a specified interest-rate level (the strike price or cap rate), the cap holder is entitled to receive cash payments equal to the excess of the market rate over the strike price multiplied by the notional principal amount.  For example, an issuer of floating-rate debt may purchase a cap to protect against rising interest rates, while retaining the ability to benefit from a decline in rates.

Interest rate floors are option contracts in which the floor seller, in return for a premium, agrees to limit the risk associated with a decline in interest rates based on a notional amount.  If rates fall below an agreed rate, the floor holder will receive cash payments from the floor writer equal to the difference between the market rate and an agreed rate, multiplied by the notional principal amount.

Interest rate collars are option contracts that combine a cap and a floor (one held and one written). Interest rate collars enable a user with a floating rate contract to lock into a predetermined interest-rate range often at a lower cost than a cap or a floor.

Embedded Derivatives

Contracts that do not in their entirety meet the definition of a derivative instrument, such as bonds, insurance policies, and leases, may contain "embedded" derivative instruments.  Embedded derivatives are implicit or explicit terms within a contract that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of other exchanges required by the contract in a manner similar to a derivative instrument.  The effect of embedding a derivative instrument in another type of contract ("the host contract") is that some or all of the cash flows or other exchanges that otherwise would be required by the host contract, whether unconditional or contingent upon the occurrence of a specified event, will be modified based on one or more of the underlyings.

An embedded derivative instrument shall be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative instrument, i.e., bifurcated, if and only if all three of the following conditions are met:

(1) The economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract,

(2) The contract ("the hybrid instrument") that embodies the embedded derivative and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and

(3) A separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be a considered a derivative.

An embedded derivative instrument in which the underlying is an interest rate or interest rate index that alters net interest payments that otherwise would be paid or received on an interest-bearing host contract is considered to be clearly and closely related to the host contract unless either of the following conditions exist:

(1) The hybrid instrument can contractually be settled in such a way that the investor (holder) would not recover substantially all of its initial recorded investment, or

(2) The embedded derivative could at least double the investor's initial rate of return on the host contract and could also result in a rate of return that is at least twice what otherwise would be the market return for a contract that has the same terms as the host contract and that involves a debtor with a similar credit quality.

Examples of hybrid instruments (not held for trading purposes) with embedded derivatives which meet the three conditions listed above and must be accounted for separately include debt instruments (including deposit liabilities) whose return or yield is indexed to: changes in an equity securities index (e.g., the Standard &amp; Poor's 500); changes in the price of a specific equity security; or changes in the price of gold, crude oil, or some other commodity.  For purposes of these reports, when an embedded derivative must be accounted for separately from the host contract under Statement No. 133, the carrying value of the host contract and the fair value of the embedded derivative may be combined and presented together on the balance sheet in the asset or liability category appropriate to the host contract.

Under FASB Statement No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments," a bank with a hybrid instrument for which bifurcation would otherwise be required is permitted to irrevocably elect to initially and subsequently measure the hybrid instrument in its entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.  In addition, Statement No. 155 subjects all but the simplest forms of interest-only and principal-only strips and all forms of beneficial interests in securitized financial assets to the requirements of Statement No. 133.  Thus, a bank must evaluate such instruments to identify those that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation.  However, a beneficial interest that contains a concentration of credit risk in the form of subordination to another financial instrument and certain securitized interests in prepayable financial assets are not considered to contain embedded derivatives that must be accounted for separately from the host contract.  (For further information, see Statement No. 155 and Derivatives Implementation Group Issue No. B40, "Application of Paragraph 13(b) to Securitized Interests in Prepayable Financial Assets.")

Except in limited circumstances, interest-only and principal-only strips and beneficial interests in securitized assets that were recognized prior to the effective date (or early adoption date) of Statement No. 155 are not subject to evaluation for embedded derivatives under Statement No. 133.  (For further information, see Derivatives Implementation Group Issue No. D1, "Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.")

Recognition of Derivatives and Measurement of Derivatives and Hedged Items

A bank should recognize all of its derivative instruments on its balance sheet as either assets or liabilities at fair value.  As defined in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (formerly FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements"), fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  For further information, see the Glossary entry for "fair value."

The accounting for changes in the fair value (that is, gains and losses) of a derivative depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, on the reason for holding it.  Either all or a proportion of a derivative may be designated as a hedging instrument.  The proportion must be expressed as a percentage of the entire derivative.  Gains and losses on derivative instruments are accounted for as follows:

(1)  No hedging designation - The gain or loss on a derivative instrument not designated as a hedging instrument, including all derivatives held for trading purposes, is recognized currently in earnings.

(2)  Fair value hedge - For a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment, which is referred to as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged should be recognized currently in earnings.

(3)  Cash flow hedge - For a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to variable cash flows of an existing recognized asset or liability or a forecasted transaction, which is referred to as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative should initially be reported outside of earnings as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, (i.e., the ineffective portion of the gain or loss and any component of the gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness) should be recognized currently in earnings.

(4)  Foreign currency hedge - For a derivative designated as hedging the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, the gain or loss is reported outside of earnings in other comprehensive income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment.  For a derivative designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of an unrecognized firm commitment or an available-for-sale security, the accounting for a fair value hedge should be applied.  Similarly, for a derivative designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a foreign-currency denominated forecasted transaction, the accounting for a cash flow hedge should be applied.

To qualify for hedge accounting, the risk being hedged must represent an exposure to an institution's earnings.  In general, if the hedged item is a financial asset or liability, the designated risk being hedged can be (1) all risks, i.e., the risk of changes in the overall fair value of the hedged item or the risk of overall changes in the hedged cash flows; (2) the risk of changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate;[1] (3) the risk of changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates; or (4) the risk of changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to changes in the obligor's creditworthiness.  For held-to-maturity securities, only credit risk, foreign exchange risk, or both may be hedged. 

Designated hedging instruments and hedged items qualify for fair value or cash flow hedge accounting if all of the criteria specified in ASC Topic 815 are met.  These criteria include:

(1)  At inception of the hedge, there is formal documentation of the hedging relationship and the institution's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the hedging instrument's effectiveness will be assessed.  There must be a reasonable basis for how the institution plans to assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness.

(2)  Both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated or the term of the hedge.  An assessment of effectiveness is required whenever financial statements or earnings are reported, and at least every three months.  All assessments of effectiveness shall be consistent with the risk management strategy documented for that particular hedging relationship.

In a fair value hedge, an asset or a liability is eligible for designation as a hedged item if the hedged item is specifically identified as either all or a specific portion of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment, the hedged item is a single asset or liability (or a specific portion thereof) or is a portfolio of similar assets or a portfolio of similar liabilities (or a specific portion thereof), and certain other criteria specified in ASC Topic 815 are met.  If similar assets or similar liabilities are aggregated and hedged as a portfolio, the individual assets or individual liabilities must share the risk exposure for which they are designated as being hedged.  The change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk for each individual item in a hedged portfolio must be expected to respond in a generally proportionate manner to the overall change in fair value of the aggregate portfolio attributable to the hedged risk.

In a cash flow hedge, the individual cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability and the cash flows related to a forecasted transaction are both referred to as a forecasted transaction.  Thus, a forecasted transaction is eligible for designation as a hedged transaction if the forecasted transaction is specifically identified as a single transaction or a group of individual transactions, the occurrence of the forecasted transaction is probable, and certain other criteria specified in ASC Topic 815 are met.  If the hedged transaction is a group of individual transactions, those individual transactions must share the same risk exposure for which they are designated as being hedged.  

An institution should discontinue prospectively its use of fair value or cash flow hedge accounting for an existing hedge if any of the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting is no longer met; the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; or the institution removes the designation of the hedge.  When this occurs for a cash flow hedge, the net gain or loss on the derivative should remain in "Accumulated other comprehensive income" and be reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  However, if it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period (as documented at the inception of the hedging relationship) or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter (except as noted in ASC Topic 815), the derivative gain or loss reported in "Accumulated other comprehensive income" should be reclassified into earnings immediately. 

For a fair value hedge, in general, if a periodic assessment of hedge effectiveness indicates noncompliance with the highly effective criterion that must be met in order to qualify for hedge accounting, an institution should not recognize adjustment of the carrying amount of the hedged item for the change in the item's fair value attributable to the hedged risk after the last date on which compliance with the effectiveness criterion was established.

With certain limited exceptions, a nonderivative instrument, such as a U.S. Treasury security, may not be designated as a hedging instrument.  

Reporting Derivative Contracts

When an institution enters into a derivative contract, it should classify the derivative as either held for trading or held for purposes other than trading (end-user derivatives) based on the reasons for entering into the contract.  All derivatives must be reported at fair value on the balance sheet (Schedule RC).

Trading derivatives with positive fair values should be reported as trading assets in Schedule RC, item 5.  Trading derivatives with negative fair values should be reported as trading liabilities in Schedule RC, item 15.  Changes in the fair value (that is, gains and losses) of trading derivatives should be recognized currently in earnings and included in Schedule RI, item 5.c, "Trading revenue."

Freestanding derivatives held for purposes other than trading (and embedded derivatives that are accounted for separately under Statement No. 133, which the bank has chosen to present separately from the host contract on the balance sheet) that have positive fair values should be included in Schedule RC-F, item 6, "All other assets."  If the total fair value of these derivatives exceeds 25 percent of "All other assets," this amount should be disclosed in Schedule RC-F, item 6.c.  Freestanding derivatives held for purposes other than trading (and embedded derivatives that are accounted for separately under Statement No. 133, which the bank has chosen to present separately from the host contract on the balance sheet) that have negative fair values should be included in Schedule RC-G, item 4, "All other liabilities."  If the total fair value of these derivatives exceeds 25 percent of "All other liabilities," this amount should be disclosed in Schedule RC-G, item 4.d.  Net gains (losses) on derivatives held for purposes other than trading that are not designated as hedging instruments should be recognized currently in earnings and reported consistently as either "Other noninterest income" or "Other noninterest expense" in Schedule RI, item 5.l or item 7.d, respectively.

Netting of derivative assets and liabilities is prohibited on the balance sheet except as permitted under FASB Interpretation No. 39.  See the Glossary entry for "offsetting."

Banks must report the notional amounts of their derivative contracts (both freestanding derivatives and embedded derivatives that are accounted for separately from their host contract under Statement No. 133) by risk exposure in Schedule RC-L, first by type of contract in Schedule RC-L, item 12, and then by purpose of contract (i.e., trading, other than trading) in Schedule RC-L, items 13 and 14.  Banks must then report the gross fair values of their derivatives, both positive and negative, by risk exposure and purpose of contract in Schedule RC-L, item 15.  However, these items exclude credit derivatives, the notional amounts and gross fair values of which must be reported in Schedule RC-L, item 7.


[1]  The benchmark interest rate is a widely recognized and quoted rate in an active financial market that is broadly indicative of the overall level of interest rates attributable to high-credit-quality obligors in that market.  In theory, this should be a risk-free rate.  In the U.S., interest rates on U.S. Treasury securities and the LIBOR swap rate are considered benchmark interest rates.</label>

Cash dividends on preferred and common stock are to be reported on the date they are declared by the bank's board of directors (the declaration date) by debiting "retained earnings" and crediting "dividends declared not yet payable," which is to be reported in other liabilities.  Upon payment of the dividend, "dividends declared not yet payable" is debited for the amount of the cash dividend with an offsetting credit, normally in an equal amount, to "dividend checks outstanding" which is reportable in the "demand deposits" category of the bank's deposit liabilities.

	A liability for dividends payable may not be accrued in advance of the formal declaration of a dividend by the board of directors.  However, the bank may segregate a portion of retained earnings in the form of a net worth reserve in anticipation of the declaration of a dividend.

	Stock dividends are distributions of additional shares to stockholders in proportion to the number of shares they own.  Stock dividends are to be reported by transferring an amount equal to the fair value of the additional shares issued from retained earnings to a category of permanent capitalization (common stock and surplus).  However, the amount transferred from retained earnings must be reduced by the amount of any mandatory and discretionary transfers previously made (such as those from retained earnings to surplus for increasing the bank's legal lending limit) provided such transfers have not already been used to record a stock dividend.  In any event, the amount transferred from retained earnings may not be less than the par or stated value of the additional shares being issued.

	Property dividends, also known as dividends in kind, are distributions to stockholders of assets other than cash.  The transfer of securities of other companies, real property, or any other asset owned by the reporting bank to a stockholder or related party is to be recorded at the fair value of the asset on the declaration date of the dividend.  A gain or loss on the transferred asset must be recognized in the same manner as if the property had been disposed of in an outright sale at or near the declaration date.  In those instances where a bank transfers bank premises to a parent holding company in the form of a property dividend and the parent immediately enters into a sale-leaseback transaction with a third party, the gain must be deferred by the bank and amortized over the life of the lease.

transactions involve the reporting bank's lending (federal funds sold) or borrowing (federal funds purchased) in domestic offices of immediately available funds under agreements or contracts that have an original maturity of one business day or roll over under a continuing contract.  However, funds lent or borrowed in the form of securities resale or repurchase agreements, due bills, borrowings from the Discount and Credit Department of a Federal Reserve Bank, deposits with and advances from a Federal Home Loan Bank, and overnight loans for commercial and industrial purposes are excluded from federal funds.  Transactions that are to be reported as federal funds transactions may be secured or unsecured or may involve an agreement to resell loans or other instruments that are not securities.

Immediately available funds are funds that the purchasing bank can either use or dispose of on the same business day that the transaction giving rise to the receipt or disposal of the funds is executed.

The borrowing and lending of immediately available funds has an original maturity of one business day if the funds borrowed on one business day are to be repaid or the transaction reversed on the next business day, that is, if immediately available funds borrowed today are to be repaid tomorrow (in tomorrow's immediately available funds).  Such transactions include those made on a Friday to mature or be reversed the following Monday and those made on the last business day prior to a holiday (for either or both of the parties to the transaction) to mature or be reversed on the first business day following the holiday.  

A continuing contract is a contract or agreement that remains in effect for more than one business day, but has no specified maturity and does not require advance notice of either party to terminate.  Such contracts may also be known as rollovers or as open ended agreements.

Federal funds may take the form of the following two types of transactions in domestic offices provided that the transactions meet the above criteria (i.e., immediately available funds with an original maturity of one business day or under a continuing contract):

(1)	Unsecured loans (federal funds sold) or borrowings (federal funds purchased).  (In some market usage, the term "fed funds" or "pure fed funds" is confined to unsecured loans of immediately available balances.)

(2)	Purchases (sales) of financial assets (other than securities) under agreements to resell (repurchase) that have original maturities of one business day (or are under continuing contracts) and are in immediately available funds.

Any borrowing or lending of immediately available funds in domestic offices that has an original maturity of more than one business day, other than securities repurchase or resale agreements, is to be treated as a borrowing or as a loan, not as federal funds.  Such transactions are sometimes referred to as "term federal funds."

Subsequent to the issuance of Statement No. 144, AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 92-3, "Accounting for Foreclosed Assets," was rescinded.  Certain provisions of SOP 92-3 are not present in Statement No. 144, but the application of these provisions represents prevalent practice in the banking industry and is consistent with safe and sound banking practices and the accounting objectives set forth in Section 37(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.  These provisions of SOP 92-3 have been incorporated into this Glossary entry, which banks must follow for purposes of preparing their Reports of Condition and Income.

A bank that receives from a borrower in full satisfaction of a loan either receivables from a third party, an equity interest in the borrower, or another type of asset (except a long-lived asset that will be sold) shall initially measure the asset received at its fair value at the time of the restructuring.  When a bank receives a long-lived asset, such as real estate, from a borrower in full satisfaction of a loan, the long lived asset is rebuttably presumed to be held for sale and the bank shall initially measure this asset at its fair value less cost to sell.  The fair value (less cost to sell, if applicable) of the asset received in full satisfaction of the loan becomes the "cost" of the asset.  The amount, if any, by which the recorded amount of the loan[1] exceeds the fair value (less cost to sell, if applicable) of the asset is a loss which must be charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses at the time of restructuring, foreclosure, or repossession.  In those cases where property is received in full satisfaction of an asset other than a loan (e.g., a debt security), the loss should be reported on the income statement in a manner consistent with the balance sheet classification of the asset satisfied. 
 

If an asset is sold shortly after it is received in a restructuring, foreclosure, or repossession, it would generally be appropriate to substitute the value received in the sale (net of the cost to sell for a long-lived asset, such as real estate, that has been sold) for the fair value (less cost to sell for a long-lived asset, such as real estate, that will be sold) that had been estimated at the time of restructuring, foreclosure, or repossession.  Any adjustments should be made to the loss charged against the allowance.  

An asset received in partial satisfaction of a loan should be initially measured as described above and the recorded amount of the loan should be reduced by the fair value (less cost to sell, if applicable) of the asset at the time of restructuring, foreclosure, or repossession.

The measurement and accounting subsequent to acquisition for real estate received in full or partial satisfaction of a loan, including through foreclosure or repossession, is discussed below in this Glossary entry.  For other types of assets that a bank receives in full or partial satisfaction of a loan, the bank generally should subsequently measure and account for such assets in accordance with other applicable generally accepted accounting principles and regulatory reporting instructions for such assets.

For purposes of these reports, foreclosed assets (other than residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan) include loans where the bank, as creditor, has received physical possession of a borrower's assets, regardless of whether formal foreclosure proceedings take place.  A bank, as creditor, is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan only upon the occurrence of either of the following:

(1) The bank obtains legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure even if the borrower has redemption rights whereby they have a legal right for a period of time after a foreclosure to reclaim the real estate property by paying certain amounts specified by law.

(2) The borrower conveys all interest in the residential real estate property to the bank to satisfy the loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement.  The deed in lieu of foreclosure or similar legal agreement is completed when agreed-upon terms and conditions have been satisfied by both the borrower and the creditor.[2]  

In such situations, the secured loan should be recategorized on the balance sheet in the asset category appropriate to the underlying collateral (e.g., as other real estate owned for real estate collateral) and accounted for as described above.

The amount of any senior debt (principal and accrued interest) to which foreclosed real estate is subject at the time of foreclosure must be reported as a liability in Schedule RC-M, item 5.b, "Other borrowings."

After foreclosure, each foreclosed real estate asset (including any real estate for which the bank receives physical possession) must be carried at the lower of (1) the fair value of the asset minus the estimated costs to sell the asset or (2) the cost of the asset (as defined in the preceding paragraphs).  This determination must be made on an asset-by-asset basis.  If the fair value of a foreclosed real estate asset minus the estimated costs to sell the asset is less than the asset's cost, the deficiency must be recognized as a valuation allowance against the asset which is created through a charge to expense.  The valuation allowance should thereafter be increased or decreased (but not below zero) through charges or credits to expense for changes in the asset's fair value or estimated selling costs.

If a foreclosed real estate asset is held for more than a short period of time, any declines in value after foreclosure and any gain or loss from the sale or disposition of the asset shall not be reported as a loan or lease loss or recovery and shall not be debited or credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Such additional declines in value and the gain or loss from the sale or disposition shall be reported net on the income statement in Schedule RI, item 5.j, "Net gains (losses) on sales of other real estate owned."  

Dispositions of Foreclosed Real Estate - The primary accounting guidance for sales of foreclosed real estate is ASC Subtopic 360-20, Property, Plant, and Equipment - Real Estate Sales (formerly FASB Statement No. 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate").  This standard, which applies to all transactions in which the seller provides financing to the buyer of the real estate, establishes the following methods to account for dispositions of real estate.  If a profit is involved in the sale of real estate, each method sets forth the manner in which the profit is to be recognized.  Regardless of which method is used, however, any losses on the disposition of real estate should be recognized immediately.

Full Accrual Method - Under the full accrual method, the disposition is recorded as a sale.  Any profit resulting from the sale is recognized in full and the asset resulting from the seller's financing of the transaction is reported as a loan.  This method may be used when the following conditions have been met:

(1) A sale has been consummated;
(2) The buyer's initial investment (down payment) and continuing investment (periodic payments) are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property;
(3) The receivable is not subject to future subordination; and
(4) The usual risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.

Guidelines for the minimum down payment that must be made in order for a transaction to qualify for the full accrual method are set forth in the Appendix A to ASC Subtopic 360-20.  These vary from five percent to 25 percent of the property's sales value.  These guideline percentages vary by type of property and are primarily based on the inherent risk assumed for the type and characteristics of the property.  To meet the continuing investment criteria, the contractual loan payments must be sufficient to repay the loan over the customary loan term for the type of property involved.  Such periods may range up to 30 years for loans on single family residential property.

Installment Method - Dispositions of foreclosed real estate that do not qualify for the full accrual method may qualify for the installment method.  This method recognizes a sale and the corresponding loan.  Any profits on the sale are only recognized as the bank receives payments from the purchaser/borrower.  Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis, when appropriate.

The installment method is used when the buyer's down payment is not adequate to allow use of the full accrual method but recovery of the cost of the property is reasonably assured if the buyer defaults. Assurance of recovery requires careful judgment on a case-by-case basis.  Factors which should be considered include:  the size of the down payment, loan-to-value ratios, projected cash flows from the property, recourse provisions, and guarantees.

Since default on the loan usually results in the seller's reacquisition of the real estate, reasonable assurance of cost recovery may often be achieved with a relatively small down payment.  This is especially true in situations involving loans with recourse to borrowers who have verifiable net worth, liquid assets, and income levels.  Reasonable assurance of cost recovery may also be achieved when the purchaser/borrower pledges additional collateral.

Cost Recovery Method - Dispositions of foreclosed real estate that do not qualify for either the full accrual or installment methods are sometimes accounted for using the cost recovery method.  This method recognizes a sale and the corresponding loan, but all income recognition is deferred.  Principal payments are applied as a reduction of the loan balance and interest increases the unrecognized gross profit.  No profit or interest income is recognized until either the aggregate payments by the borrower exceed the recorded amount of the loan or a change to another accounting method is appropriate (e.g., installment method).  Consequently, the loan is maintained in nonaccrual status while this method is being used.

Reduced-Profit Method - This method is used in certain situations where the bank receives an adequate down payment, but the loan amortization schedule does not meet the requirements for use of the full accrual method.  The method recognizes a sale and the corresponding loan.  However, like the installment method, any profit is apportioned over the life of the loan as payments are received.  The method of apportionment differs from the installment method in that profit recognition is based on the present value of the lowest level of periodic payments required under the loan agreement.

Since sales with adequate down payments are generally not structured with inadequate loan amortization requirements, this method is seldom used in practice.

Deposit Method - The deposit method is used in situations where a sale of the foreclosed real estate has not been consummated.  It may also be used for dispositions that could be accounted for under the cost recovery method.  Under this method a sale is not recorded and the asset continues to be reported as foreclosed real estate.  Further, no profit or interest income is recognized.  Payments received from the borrower are reported as a liability until sufficient payments or other events have occurred which allow the use of one of the other methods.

The preceding discussion represents a brief summary of the methods included in ASC Subtopic 360-20 for accounting for sales of real estate.  Refer to ASC Subtopic 360-20 for a more complete description of the accounting principles that apply to sales of real estate, including the determination of the down payment percentage.


[1]  The recorded amount of the loan is the loan balance adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount and unamortized loan fees or costs, less any amount previously charged off, plus recorded accrued interest.

[2]  Refer to Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-04, "Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure," for transition guidance.  For institutions with a calendar year fiscal year, the ASU must be applied by public business entities in their March 2015 Call Reports and by private companies in their December 2015 Call Reports.  Early adoption is permitted.  Institutions can elect either a prospective or modified retrospective transition approach.  Under the modified retrospective transition approach, an institution should apply a cumulative-effect adjustment to residential consumer mortgage loans and other real estate owned existing as of the beginning of the annual period for which the ASU is effective.</label>

Foreign currency translation, on the other hand, is the process of translating financial statements from the foreign office's functional currency into the reporting currency.  Such translation normally is performed only at reporting dates.

A functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an office operates.  For most banks, the functional currency will be the U.S. dollar.  However, if a bank has foreign offices, one or more foreign offices may have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar.

Accounting for foreign currency transactions -- A change in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated will increase or decrease the amount of the functional currency expected to be received or paid.  These increases or decreases in the expected functional currency cash flow are foreign currency transaction gains and losses and are to be included in the determination of the income of the period in which the transaction takes place, or if the transaction has not yet settled, the period in which the rate change takes place.

Except for foreign currency derivatives and transactions described in the following section, banks should consistently report net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions other than trading transactions in Schedule RI, item 5.l, "Other noninterest income," or item 7.d, "Other noninterest expense."  Net gains (losses) from foreign currency trading transactions should be reported in Schedule RI, item 5.c, "Trading revenue."

Foreign currency transaction gains or losses to be excluded from the determination of net income -- Gains and losses on the following foreign currency transactions shall not be included in "Noninterest income" or "Noninterest expense," but shall be reported in the same manner as translation adjustments (as described below):

	(1) Foreign currency transactions that are designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of a net investment in a foreign office.

	(2) Intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future), when the parties to the transaction are consolidated, combined, or accounted for by the equity method in the bank's Reports of Condition and Income.

In addition, the entire change in the fair value of foreign-currency-denominated available-for-sale debt securities should not be included in "Realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities" (Schedule RI, item 6.b), but should be reported in Schedule RI-A, item 10, "Other comprehensive income."  These fair value changes should be accumulated in the "Net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities" component of "Accumulated other comprehensive income" in Schedule RC, item 26.b.  However, if a decline in fair value of a foreign-currency-denominated available-for-sale debt security is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security shall be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down shall be included in earnings (Schedule RI, item 6.b).

See the Glossary entry for "derivative contracts" for information on the accounting and reporting for foreign currency derivatives.

Accounting for foreign currency translation (applicable only to banks with foreign offices) -- The Reports of Condition and Income must be reported in U.S. dollars.  Balances of foreign subsidiaries or branches of the reporting bank denominated in a functional currency other than U.S. dollars shall be converted to U.S. dollar equivalents and consolidated into the reporting bank's Reports of Condition and Income.  The translation adjustments for each reporting period, determined utilizing the current rate method, should be reported in Schedule RI-A, item 10, "Other comprehensive income."  Amounts accumulated in the "Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments" component of "Accumulated other comprehensive income" in Schedule RC, item 26.b, will not be included in the bank's results of operations until such time as the foreign office is disposed of, when they will be used as an element to determine the gain or loss on disposition.

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-line-770999_lbl_301" xml:lang="en">Foreign debt exchange transactions generally fall into three categories:  (1) loan swaps, (2) debt/equity swaps, and (3) debt-for-development swaps.  These transactions are to be reported in the Reports of Condition and Income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as summarized below.  The accounting pronouncements mentioned below should be consulted for more detailed reporting guidance in these areas.

Generally accepted accounting principles require that these transactions be reported at their fair value.  There is a significant amount of precedent in the accounting for exchange transactions to consider both the fair value of the consideration given up as well as the fair value of the assets received in arriving at the most informed valuation, especially if the value of the consideration given up is not readily determinable or may not be a good indicator of the value received.  It is the responsibility of management to make the valuation considering all of the circumstances.  Such valuations are subject to examiner review.

Among the factors to consider in determining fair values for foreign debt exchange transactions are:

	(1) Similar transactions for cash;

	(2) Estimated cash flows from the debt or equity instruments or other assets received;

	(3) Market values, if any, of similar instruments; and

	(4) Currency restrictions, if any, affecting payments on or sales of the debt or equity instruments, local currency, or other assets received, including where appropriate those affecting the repatriation of capital.

Losses arise from swap transactions when the fair value determined for the transaction is less than the recorded investment in the sovereign debt and other consideration paid, if any.  Such losses should generally be charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses (or allocated transfer risk reserve, if appropriate) and must include any discounts from official exchange rates that are imposed by sovereign obligors as transaction fees.  All other fees and transaction costs involved in such transactions must be charged to expense as incurred.

Loss recoveries or even gains might be indicated in a swap transaction as a result of the valuation process.  However, due to the subjective nature of the valuation process, such loss recoveries or gains ordinarily should not be recorded until the debt or equity instruments, local currency, or other assets received in the exchange transaction are realized in unrestricted cash or cash equivalents.

Loan swaps - The reporting guidance for this type of transaction is presented in the AICPA's Notice to Practitioners, "Accounting for Foreign Loan Swaps," issued on May 27, 1985.

Foreign loan swaps, or debt/debt swaps, involve the exchange of one foreign loan for another.  This type of transaction represents an exchange of monetary assets that must be reported at current fair value.  Normally, when monetary assets are exchanged, with or without additional cash payments, and the parties have no remaining obligations to each other, the earnings process is complete.

Debt/equity swaps - The reporting treatment for this type of transaction is presented in AICPA Practice Bulletin No. 4, "Accounting for Foreign Debt/Equity Swaps."

A foreign debt/equity swap represents an exchange of monetary for nonmonetary assets that must be measured at fair value.  This type of swap is typically accomplished when holders of U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign debt agree to convert that debt into approved local equity investments.  The holders are generally credited with local currency at the official exchange rate.  A discount from the official exchange rate is often imposed as a transaction fee.  The local currency is generally not available to the holders for any purposes other than approved equity investments.  Restrictions may be placed on dividends on the equity investments and capital usually cannot be repatriated for several years.

In arriving at the fair value of the transaction, both the secondary market price of the debt given up and the fair value of the equity investment or assets received should be considered.

Debt-for-development swaps - In this type of exchange, sovereign debt held by a bank is generally purchased by a nonprofit organization or contributed to the nonprofit the nonprofit organization.  When the sovereign debt is purchased by or donated to a nonprofit organization, the organization may enter into an agreement with the debtor country to cancel the debt in return for the country's commitment to provide local currency or other assets for use in connection with specific projects or programs in that country.  Alternatively, a bank may exchange the sovereign debt with the country and receive local currency.  In this alternative, the local currency will be donated or sold to the nonprofit organization for use in connection with specific projects or programs in that country.

These transactions, including amounts charged to expense as donations, must be reported at their fair values in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to foreign debt exchange transactions.  This includes appropriate consideration of the market value of the instruments involved in the transaction and the fair value of any assets received, taking into account any restrictions that would limit the use of the assets.  In debt-for-development swaps where a bank receives local currency in exchange for the sovereign loan it held and the local currency has no restrictions on its use and is freely convertible, it is generally appropriate for fair value to be determined by valuing the local currency received at its fair market exchange value.</label>

ASC Topic 805 requires that all business combinations, which are defined as the acquisition of assets and assumption of liabilities that constitute a business, be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.  The formation of a joint venture, the acquisition of a group of assets that do not constitute a business, and a transfer of net assets or exchange of equity interests between entities under common control are not considered business combinations and therefore are not accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.

Acquisition method - Under the acquisition method, the acquirer in a business combination shall measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition-date fair values (with limited exceptions specified in ASC Topic 805) using the definition of fair value in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (formerly FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements").  The acquisition date is generally the date on which the acquirer legally transfers the consideration, acquires the assets, and assumes the liabilities of the acquiree, i.e., the closing date.  ASC Topic 805 requires the acquirer to measure acquired receivables, including loans, at their acquisition-date fair values and the acquirer may not recognize a separate valuation allowance (e.g., allowance for loan and lease losses) for the contractual cash flows that are deemed to be uncollectible as of that date.  The consideration transferred in a business combination shall be calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets (including any cash) transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree, and the equity interests issued by the acquirer.  Acquisition-related costs are costs the acquirer incurs to effect a business combination such as finder's fees; advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees; and general administrative costs.  The acquirer shall account for acquisition-related costs as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services received.  The cost to register and issue debt or equity securities shall be recognized in accordance with other applicable generally accepted accounting principles.

ASC Topic 805 provides guidance for recognizing particular assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.  Acquired assets may be tangible (such as securities or fixed assets) or intangible, as discussed in the following paragraph.  An acquiring entity must not recognize the goodwill, if any, or the deferred income taxes recorded by an acquired entity before the business combination.  However, a deferred tax liability or asset must be recognized for differences between the carrying values assigned in the business combination and the tax bases of the recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (formerly FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," and FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes").  (For further information, see the Glossary entry for "income taxes.")

Under ASC Topic 805, an intangible asset must be recognized separately from goodwill if it arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether the rights are transferable or separable.  Otherwise, an intangible asset must be recognized separately from goodwill only if it is capable of being separated or divided from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged individually or together with a related contract, identifiable asset, or liability.  Examples of intangible assets that must be recognized separately from goodwill are core deposit intangibles, purchased credit card relationships, servicing assets, favorable leasehold rights, trademarks, trade names, internet domain names, and noncompetition agreements.  These intangible assets must be reported in Schedule RC, item 10.b, "Other intangible assets," and in Schedule RC-M, item 2. 

In general, the amount recognized as goodwill in a business combination is the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred and the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.  Goodwill is reported in Schedule RC, item 10.a.  An acquired intangible asset that does not meet the criteria described in the preceding paragraph must be treated as goodwill.  After initial recognition, goodwill must be accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (formerly FASB Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets") and the Glossary entry for "goodwill."   

In contrast, if the total acquisition-date amount of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree (i.e., a bargain purchase), the acquirer shall reassess whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all the liabilities assumed and shall recognize any additional assets or liabilities that are identified in that review.  If that excess remains after the review, the acquirer shall recognize that excess in earnings as a gain attributable to the acquirer on the acquisition date and report the amount in Schedule RI, item 5.l, "Other noninterest income."  

Under the acquisition method, the historical equity capital balances of the acquired business are not to be carried forward to the acquirer's consolidated balance sheet.  The operating results of the acquiree are to be included in the income and expenses of the acquirer only from the acquisition date.  In addition, if the ownership interests in the acquiree were obtained in a series of purchase transactions, the equity interest in the acquiree previously held by the acquirer is remeasured at its acquisition-date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the acquirer's earnings.

Push down accounting - Pushdown accounting is an acquiree's establishment of a new accounting basis in its separate financial statements when an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity.  On November 18, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-17, "Pushdown Accounting," which amended ASC Subtopic 805-50, Business Combinations-Related Issues, and took effect upon issuance.  Under ASU 2014-17, an acquiree that retains its separate corporate existence may apply pushdown accounting upon a change-in-control event.  A change-in-control event occurs when an acquirer obtains a controlling financial interest, as defined by ASC Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation-Overall (formerly Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements"), in the acquiree.  A controlling financial interest typically requires ownership of more than 50 percent of the voting rights in an acquired entity.

When an acquiree elects pushdown accounting, it must report in its separate financial statements the new basis of accounting established by the acquirer under which the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests are restated to their acquisition-date fair values (with limited exceptions specified in ASC Topic 805) using the definition of fair value in ASC Topic 820.  The assets acquired, including goodwill, and liabilities assumed, measured at their acquisition-date fair values, are reported in the separate financial statements of the acquired institution and the consolidated financial statements of the institution's parent.  However, any bargain purchase gain recognized by the acquirer when applying the acquisition method should not be reported in the acquired institution's income statement (Schedule RI).  The effect of any bargain purchase gain recognized by the acquirer should be reflected in the acquisition-date measurement of the acquired institution's surplus (additional paid-in capital) account, not in the acquired institution's income statement. 

An acquired institution that retains its separate corporate existence may, for purposes of its Call Report, elect pushdown accounting in accordance with ASU 2014-17 if the change-in-control event for the business combination occurred on or after October 1, 2014.  Prior to the issuance of ASU 2014-17, pushdown accounting for business combinations, including those involving collaborative groups, was permitted for Call Report purposes when 80 percent or more voting control was obtained and required when voting control was 95 percent or more.  An institution acquired in a business combination before October 1, 2014, that retained its separate legal existence should not change the pushdown treatment applied to the acquisition because of the issuance of ASU 2014-17.  It should be noted that after a parent obtains a controlling financial interest in an entity through a business combination, any subsequent increase in the parent's ownership interest in the acquiree is not a change in control.  However, if a parent's ownership becomes a noncontrolling interest and the parent later regains control of the acquiree, the latter transaction would be a change-in-control event at which a new pushdown election could be made in accordance with ASC Subtopic 805-50.
  
In the Reports of Condition and Income for the remainder of the year in which an institution elects to apply pushdown accounting, the institution shall report the initial increase or decrease in its equity capital that results from the application of pushdown accounting in item 7, "Changes incident to business combinations, net," of Schedule RI-A, Changes in Bank Equity Capital.  In addition, when pushdown accounting is used, no income or expense for the period of the calendar year prior to the date of the change in control should be included in subsequent Reports of Income.

The agencies note that the pushdown accounting election available under ASU 2014-17 can be used to produce a particular result in the Call Report that may not be reflective of the economic substance of the underlying business combination.  Therefore, an institution's primary federal regulator reserves the right to require or prohibit the institution's use of pushdown accounting for Call Report purposes based on the regulator's evaluation of whether the election best reflects the facts and circumstances of the business combination.

Transactions between entities under common control - A transaction in which net assets or equity interests (e.g., voting shares) that constitute a business are transferred between entities under common control is not accounted for as a business combination.  The method used to account for such transactions is similar to the pooling-of-interests method.  In accordance with ASC Subtopic 805-50, when applying a method similar to the pooling-of-interests method to a transfer of net assets or an exchange of equity interests between entities under common control, the entity that receives the net assets or equity interests shall initially measure the recognized assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts in the accounts of the transferring entity at the date of transfer.  If the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities transferred differ from the historical cost of the parent of the entities under common control, for example, because pushdown accounting had not been applied, then the financial statements of the receiving entity shall reflect the transferred assets and liabilities at the historical cost of the parent of the entities under common control.  Consequently, and without regard to the pushdown accounting election made by the acquiree, if a parent transfers the acquiree to another entity under common control or merges the acquiree with another entity under common control, the receiving entity accounts for the acquiree using the parent's historical cost for the net assets or equity interests in the acquiree.  The parent's historical cost includes the values of the acquiree's assets (including goodwill) and liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on the acquisition date of the business combination.  If there has been a change in reporting entity as defined by ASC Subtopic 250-10, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections-Overall (formerly FASB Statement No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections"), for the year in which a transaction between entities under common control occurs, income and expenses must be reported in Schedule RI, Income Statement, as though the entities had combined at the beginning of the year.  The portion of the adjustment necessary to conform the accounting methods applicable to the current period must also be allocated to income and expense for the period.</label>

financial assets by one party to another, subject to an agreement by the "seller" to repurchase the assets at a specified date or in specified circumstances.  A resale agreement (also known as a reverse repurchase agreement) is a transaction involving the "purchase" of financial assets by one party from another, subject to an agreement by the "purchaser" to resell the assets at a specified date or in specified circumstances.

As stated in the AICPA's Audit and Accounting Guide for Banks and Savings Institutions, dollar repurchase agreements (also called dollar rolls) are agreements to sell and repurchase similar but not identical securities.  The dollar roll market consists primarily of agreements that involve mortgage backed securities (MBS).  Dollar rolls differ from regular repurchase agreements in that the securities sold and repurchased, which are usually of the same issuer, are represented by different certificates, are collateralized by different but similar mortgage pools (for example, single family residential mortgages), and generally have different principal amounts.

General rule -- Consistent with FASB Statement No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," repurchase and resale agreements involving financial assets (e.g. securities and loans), including dollar repurchase agreements, are either reported as (a) secured borrowings and loans or (b) sales and forward repurchase commitments based on whether the transferring ("selling") institution maintains control over the transferred assets.  (See the Glossary entry for "transfers of financial assets" for further discussion of control criteria).  
 
If a repurchase agreement both entitles and obligates the "selling" bank to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets from the transferee ("purchaser"), the "selling" bank should report the transaction as a secured borrowing if and only if the following conditions have been met:

(1)	The assets to be repurchased or redeemed are the same or "substantially the same" as those transferred, as defined by FASB Statement No. 140.

(2)	The "selling" institution has the ability to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee ("purchaser").  This ability is presumed to exist if the "selling" bank has obtained cash or other collateral sufficient to fund substantially all of the cost of purchasing replacement assets from others.

(3)	The agreement is to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets before maturity, at a fixed or determinable price.

(4)	The agreement is entered into concurrently with the transfer.

Participations in pools of securities are to be reported in the same manner as security repurchase/resale transactions.

Repurchase agreements reported as secured borrowings.  If a repurchase agreement qualifies as a secured borrowing, the "selling" institution should report the transaction as indicated below based on whether the agreement involves a security or some other financial asset.

(1)	Securities "sold" under agreements to repurchase are reported in Schedule RC, item 14.b, "Securities sold under agreements to repurchase."  

(2)	Financial assets (other than securities) "sold" under agreements to repurchase are reported as follows:

        (a)	If the repurchase agreement has an original maturity of one business day (or is under a continuing contract) and is in immediately available funds, it should be reported in Schedule RC, item 14.a, "Federal funds purchased (in domestic offices)," if it is in a domestic office, and in Schedule RC, item 16, "Other borrowed money," if it is in a foreign office.
        (b)	If the repurchase agreement has an original maturity of more than one business day or is not in immediately available funds, it should be reported in Schedule RC, item 16.

In addition, the "selling" institution may need to record further entries depending on the terms of the agreement.  If the "purchaser" has the right to sell or repledge noncash assets, the "selling" institution should recategorize the transferred financial assets as "assets receivable" and report them in Schedule RC, item 11, "Other assets."  Otherwise, the financial assets should continue to be reported in the same asset category as before the transfer (e.g., securities should continue to be reported in Schedule RC, item 2, "Securities," or item 5, "Trading assets," as appropriate).

Resale agreements reported as secured borrowings.  Similarly, if a resale agreement qualifies as a secured borrowing, the "purchasing" institution should report the transaction as indicated below based on whether the agreement involves a security or some other financial asset.

(1)	Securities "purchased" under agreements to resell are reported in Schedule RC, item 3.b, "Securities purchased under agreements to resell."  

(2)	Financial assets (other than securities) "purchased" under agreements to resell are reported as follows:

	(a)	If the resale agreement has an original maturity of one business day (or is under a continuing contract) and is in immediately available funds, it should be reported in Schedule RC, item 3.a, "Federal funds sold (in domestic offices)," if it is in a domestic office, and in Schedule RC, item 4.b, "Loans and leases, net of unearned income," if it is in a foreign office. 
	(b)	If the resale agreement has an original maturity of more than one business day or is not in immediately available funds, it should be reported in Schedule RC, item 4.b.

In addition, the "purchasing" institution may need to record further entries depending on the terms of the agreement.  If the "purchasing" institution has the right to sell the noncash assets it has "purchased" and sells these assets, it should recognize the proceeds from the sale and report its obligation to return the assets in Schedule RC, item 20, "Other liabilities."  If the "selling" institution defaults under the terms of the repurchase agreement and is no longer entitled to redeem the noncash assets, the "purchasing" bank should recognize these assets on its own balance sheet (e.g., securities should be reported in Schedule RC, item 2, "Securities," or item 5, "Trading assets," as appropriate) and initially measure them at fair value.  However, if the "purchasing" bank has already sold the assets it has "purchased," it should derecognize its obligation to return the assets.  Otherwise, the "purchasing" bank should not recognize the transferred financial assets (i.e., the financial assets "purchased" under the resale agreement) on its balance sheet.

Repurchase/resale agreements reported as sales -- If a repurchase agreement does not qualify as a secured borrowing under FASB Statement No. 140, the selling bank should account for the transaction as a sale of financial assets and a forward repurchase commitment.  The selling bank should remove the transferred assets from its balance sheet, record the proceeds from the sale of the transferred assets (including the forward repurchase commitment), and record any gain or loss on the transaction.  Similarly, if a resale agreement does not qualify as a borrowing under Statement No. 140, the purchasing bank should account for the transaction as a purchase of financial assets and a forward resale commitment. The purchasing bank should record the transferred assets on its balance sheet, initially measure them at fair value, and record the payment for the purchased assets (including the forward resale commitment).

Management should periodically reassess its security categorization decisions to ensure that they remain appropriate.

Securities that are intended to be held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term should be classified as trading assets.  Trading activity includes active and frequent buying and selling of securities for the purpose of generating profits on short-term fluctuations in price.  Securities held for trading purposes must be reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in current earnings and regulatory capital.

Held-to-maturity securities are debt securities that an institution has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity.  Held-to-maturity securities are generally reported at amortized cost.  Securities not categorized as trading or held-to-maturity must be reported as available-for-sale.  An institution must report its available-for-sale securities at fair value on the balance sheet, but unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of equity capital.

Under Statement No. 115, institutions must determine whether an impairment of an individual available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security is other than temporary.  An impairment occurs whenever the fair value of a security is less than its (amortized) cost basis.  If an impairment is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security shall be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down shall be included in earnings.  For example, if it is probable that an institution will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security not impaired at acquisition, an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred.  In addition, under FASB Staff Position Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, institutions should apply existing other-than-temporary impairment guidance to the determination of whether an impairment is other than temporary.  Such guidance includes SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 59, Other Than Temporary Impairment of Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (Topic 5.M. in the Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins) and EITF Issue No. 99-20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.

The proper categorization of securities is important to ensure that trading gains and losses are promptly recognized in earnings and regulatory capital.  This will not occur when securities intended to be held for trading purposes are categorized as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale.  The following practices are considered trading activities:

(1) Gains Trading -- Gains trading is characterized by the purchase of a security and the subsequent sale of the same security at a profit after a short holding period, while securities acquired for this purpose that cannot be sold at a profit are typically retained in the available-for-sale or held-to-maturity portfolio.  Gains trading may be intended to defer recognition of losses, as unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities do not directly affect regulatory capital and generally are not reported in income until the security is sold.

(2) When-Issued Securities Trading -- When-issued securities trading is the buying and selling of securities in the period between the announcement of an offering and the issuance and payment date of the securities.  A purchase of a "when-issued" security acquires the risks and rewards of owning a security and may sell the when-issued security at a profit before having to take delivery and pay for it.  Because such transactions are intended to generate profits from short-term price movements, they should be categorized as trading.

(3) Pair-offs -- Pair-offs are security purchase transactions that are closed-out or sold at, or prior to, settlement date.  In a pair-off, an institution commits to purchase a security.  Then, prior to the predetermined settlement date, the institution will pair-off the purchase with a sale of the same security.  Pair-offs are settled net when one party to the transaction remits the difference between the purchase and the sale price to the counterparty.  Pair-offs may also involve the same sequence of events using swaps, options on swaps, forward commitments, options on forward commitments, or other off-balance sheet derivative contracts.

(4) Extended Settlements -- In the U.S., regular-way settlement for federal government and federal agency securities (except mortgage-backed securities and derivative contracts) is one business day after the trade date.  Regular-way settlement for corporate and municipal securities is three business days after the trade date.  For mortgage-backed securities, it can be up to 60 days or more after the trade date.  The use of extended settlements may be offered by securities dealers in order to facilitate speculation on the part of the purchaser, often in connection with pair-off transactions.  Securities acquired through the use of a settlement period in excess of the regular-way settlement periods in order to facilitate speculation should be reported as trading assets.

(5) Repositioning Repurchase Agreements -- A repositioning repurchase agreement is a funding technique offered by a dealer in an attempt to enable an institution to avoid recognition of a loss.  Specifically, an institution that enters into a "when-issued" trade or a "pair-off" (which may include an extended settlement) that cannot be closed out at a profit on the payment or settlement date will be provided dealer financing in an effort to fund its speculative position until the security can be sold at a gain.  The institution purchasing the security typically pays the dealer a small margin that approximates the actual loss in the security.  The dealer then agrees to fund the purchase of the security, typically buying it back from the purchaser under a resale agreement.  Any securities acquired through a dealer financing technique such as a repositioning repurchase agreement that is used to fund the speculative purchase of securities should be reported as trading assets.

(6) Short Sales -- A short sale is the sale of a security that is not owned.  The purpose of a short sale generally is to speculate on a fall in the price of the security.  (For further information, see the Glossary entry for "short position.")

One other practice, referred to as "adjusted trading," is not acceptable under any circumstances.  Adjusted trading involves the sale of a security to a broker or dealer at a price above the prevailing market value and the contemporaneous purchase and booking of a different security, frequently a lower-rated or lower quality issue or one with a longer maturity, at a price above its market value.  Thus, the dealer is reimbursed for losses on the purchase from the institution and ensured a profit.  Such transactions inappropriately defer the recognition of losses on the security sold and establish an excessive cost basis for the newly acquired security.  Consequently, such transactions are prohibited and may be in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1001--False Statements or Entries and 1005--False Entries.

initiated by broker-dealers and other financial institutions that need specific securities to cover a short sale or a customer's failure to deliver securities sold.  A transferee ("borrower") of securities generally is required to provide "collateral" to the transferor ("lender") of securities, commonly cash but sometimes other securities or standby letters of credit, with a value slightly higher than that of the securities "borrowed."

Most securities borrowing/lending transactions do not qualify as sales under FASB Statement No. 140 because the agreement entitles and obligates the securities lender to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets before their maturity.  (See the Glossary entry for "transfers of financial assets" for further discussion of sale criteria.)  When such transactions do not qualify as sales, securities lenders and borrowers should account for the transactions as secured borrowings in which cash (or securities that the holder is permitted by contract or custom to sell or repledge) received as "collateral" by the securities lender is considered the amount borrowed and the securities "loaned" are considered pledged as collateral against the amount borrowed.  The "loaned" securities should continue to be reported on the securities lender's balance sheet as available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities, or trading assets, as appropriate.  "Loaned" securities that are reported as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity securities in Schedule RC-B, Securities, should also be reported as "Pledged securities" in Memorandum item 1 of that schedule. 
 

If the securities borrowing/lending transaction meets the criteria for a sale under FASB Statement No. 140, the lender of the securities should remove the securities from its balance sheet, record the proceeds from the sale of the securities (including the forward repurchase commitment), and recognize any gain or loss on the transaction.  The borrower of the securities should record the securities on its balance sheet at fair value and record the payment for the purchased assets (including the forward resale commitment).

Statement No. 140, which banks must follow for purposes of these reports, is based on consistent application of a financial components approach that focuses on control.  Under the financial components approach, after the reporting bank transfers financial assets, it recognizes the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred, removes financial assets from the balance sheet when control has been surrendered, and removes liabilities from the balance sheet when extinguished.  A summary of these accounting and reporting standards follows.  For further information, see FASB Statement No. 140, the FASB staff implementation guide to Statement No. 140, FASB Statement No. 156, and the Glossary entries for "Extinguishments of Liabilities" and "Servicing Assets and Liabilities."

A financial asset is cash, evidence of an ownership interest in another entity, or a contract that conveys to the bank a contractual right either to receive cash or another financial instrument from another entity or to exchange other financial instruments on potentially favorable terms with another entity.  Most of the assets on a bank's balance sheet are financial assets, including balances due from depository institutions, securities, federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, loans and lease financing receivables, and interest-only strips receivable.[1]  However, servicing assets are not financial assets.  Financial assets also include financial futures contracts, forward contracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate floors, and certain option contracts.

Determining Whether a Transfer Should be Accounted for as a Sale or a Secured Borrowing - A bank should account for a transfer of its financial assets (or a transfer of all or a portion of one of its financial assets) in which it surrenders control over those financial assets as a sale to the extent that it receives consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets in exchange.  According to FASB Statement No. 140, a transferor (i.e., the entity that transfers all or a portion of one or more financial assets) has surrendered control over transferred assets, and therefore has sold the assets, if and only if all three of the following conditions are met:

(1) The transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor, i.e., put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership.

(2) Each transferee (i.e., the entity that receives all or a portion of one or more financial assets from the transferor), or each holder of the beneficial interests in a qualifying special purpose entity that is a transferee, has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received, and no condition both constrains the transferee from taking advantage of that right and provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor.

(3) The transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through (a) an agreement that both entitles and obligates it to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets before their maturity or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call option.

If a transfer of financial assets in exchange for cash or other consideration (other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets) does not satisfy the criteria for sale treatment, the transfer should be accounted for as a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral.

Accounting for a Transfer That Qualifies as a Sale - Upon the completion of a transfer of financial assets that satisfies all three of the conditions to be accounted for as a sale, the purchaser(s) must recognize on the balance sheet all assets obtained and any liabilities incurred and initially measure them at fair value.  The aggregate fair value is presumed to be the price paid by the purchaser(s).  As for the selling bank, it must:

(1) Remove all assets sold from the balance sheet while continuing to carry on its balance sheet any interest it continues to hold in the transferred assets, including, if applicable, beneficial interests in assets transferred to a qualifying special-purpose entity in a securitization and undivided interests.  The selling bank must allocate the amount at which the transferred assets were carried on the balance sheet at the date of the transfer between the assets sold, if any, and the interests that continue to be held by the bank, if any, based on their relative fair values at that date.

(2) Recognize on the balance sheet all cash, derivative financial instruments, servicing assets, and other assets obtained and all servicing liabilities and other liabilities incurred in consideration as proceeds of the sale.  Derivatives include put or call options held or written (e.g., guarantee or recourse obligations), forward commitments (e.g., commitments to deliver additional receivables in some securitizations), and swaps (e.g., provisions that convert interest rates from fixed to variable).

(3) Initially measure the assets obtained and liabilities incurred in a sale (including any servicing assets or servicing liabilities) at fair value, if practicable.  However, if it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of an asset obtained, the selling bank must record the asset at zero.  If it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of a liability incurred, the selling bank must not recognize any gain on the sale.  The liability should be recorded on the balance sheet at the greater of:

	(a) The amount, if any, by which the fair values of the assets obtained in the sale less the fair values of the other liabilities incurred in the sale exceeds the sum of the carrying values of the assets transferred, or

	(b) The amount of the estimated loss that it is probable the bank has incurred in accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 14, "Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss."  Under that interpretation, when the reasonable estimate of the loss is a range and some amount within the range appears at the time to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount should be considered probable.  When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range should be considered probable.

(4) Recognize in income any gain or loss on the sale.

If, as a result of a change in circumstances, a bank transferor regains control of a financial asset previously accounted for appropriately as having been sold because one or more of the conditions for sale accounting in FASB Statement No. 140 are no longer met, such a change should be accounted for in the same manner as a purchase of the financial asset from the former transferee (purchaser) in exchange for a liability assumed.  The transferor should recognize (rebook) the financial asset on its balance sheet together with a liability to the former transferee, measuring the asset and liability at fair value on the date of the change in circumstances.  If the rebooked financial asset is a loan, it must be reported as a loan asset in Schedule RC-C, part I, either as a loan held for sale or a loan held for investment, based on facts and circumstances, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The liability to the former transferee should be reported as a secured borrowing in Schedule RC, item 16, "Other borrowed money."  This accounting and reporting treatment applies, for example, to U.S. Government-guaranteed or -insured residential mortgage loans backing Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) mortgage-backed securities that a bank services after it has securitized the loans in a transfer accounted for as a sale.  If and when individual loans later meet delinquency criteria specified by GNMA, they are eligible for repurchase (buy-back) and the bank is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans.  The delinquent loans must be brought back onto the bank's books as loan assets, regardless of whether the bank intends to exercise the buy-back option.

Banks should refer to FASB Statement No. 140 for implementation guidance for accounting for transfers of partial interests, transfers of certain lease receivables, securities lending transactions, repurchase agreements including "dollar rolls," "wash sales," loan syndications, loan participations (discussed below), risk participations in bankers acceptances, factoring arrangements, and transfers of receivables with recourse.  However, this accounting standard does not provide guidance on the accounting for most assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet following a transfer accounted for as a sale. As a result, after their initial measurement or carrying amount allocation, these assets and liabilities should be accounted for in accordance with the existing generally accepted accounting principles applicable to them.

Loan Participations - If a loan participation agreement gives a participating institution the right to pledge or exchange the participation, the isolation test has been met, and the originating lender does not maintain effective control over the participation, then the three conditions for the surrender of control set forth in FASB Statement No. 140 have been met and the originating lender should account for transfers to the participating institution as sales of financial assets.

An originating lender's right of first refusal on a bona fide offer to the participating institution from a third party, a requirement for a participating institution to obtain the originating lender's permission that shall not be unreasonably withheld, or a prohibition on the participating institution's sale of the participation to the originating lender's competitor (if other potential willing buyers exist) is a limitation on the participating institution's rights, but is presumed not to constrain a participant from exercising its right to pledge or exchange the participation.  However, if the participation agreement constrains the participating institution from pledging or exchanging its participation, the originating lender presumptively receives more than a trivial benefit, has not relinquished control over the loan, and should account for the transfer as a secured borrowing.

A loan participation agreement may give the originating lender the contractual right to repurchase a loan participation at any time.  In this situation, the right to repurchase is effectively a call option on a specific loan participation, i.e., a participation that is not readily obtainable in the marketplace.  Regardless of whether this option is freestanding or attached, it either constrains the participating institution from pledging or exchanging its participation or results in the originating lender maintaining effective control over the participation.  As a consequence, the contractual right to repurchase precludes sale accounting and the transfer should be accounted for as a secured borrowing.

In addition, under a loan participation agreement, the originating lender may give the participating institution the right to resell the participation, but reserves the right to call the loan participation at any time from whomever holds it and can enforce that right by discontinuing the flow of interest to the holder of the participation at the call date.  In this situation, the originating lender has maintained effective control over the participation and the transfer should be accounted for as a secured borrowing, not as a sale.

If an originating FDIC-insured lender has transferred a loan participation to a participating institution with recourse prior to January 1, 2002, the existence of the recourse obligation in and of itself does not preclude sale accounting for the transfer under FASB Statement No. 140.  If a loan participation transferred with recourse prior to January 1, 2002, meets the three conditions identified above in order for the transferor to have surrendered control over the transferred assets, the transfer should be accounted for as a sale for financial reporting purposes.  However, a loan participation sold with recourse is subject to the banking agencies' risk-based capital requirements as discussed in the Glossary entry for "sales of assets for risk-based capital purposes" and in the instructions for Schedule RC-R, Regulatory Capital.

If an originating FDIC-insured lender transfers a loan participation with recourse after December 31, 2001, the participation generally will not be considered isolated from the transferor, i.e., the originating lender, in the event of an FDIC receivership.  Section 360.6 of the FDIC's regulations limits the FDIC's ability to reclaim loan participations transferred "without recourse," as defined in the regulations, but does not limit the FDIC's ability to reclaim loan participations transferred with recourse.  Under Section 360.6, a participation that is subject to an agreement that requires the originating lender to repurchase the participation or to otherwise compensate the participating institution due to a default on the underlying loan is considered a participation "with recourse."  As a result, a loan participation transferred "with recourse" after December 31, 2001, generally should be accounted for as a secured borrowing and not as a sale for financial reporting purposes.  This means that the originating lender should not remove the participation from its loan assets on the balance sheet, but should report the secured borrowing in Schedule RC, item 16, "Other borrowed money."

Financial Assets Subject to Prepayment - Financial assets such as interest-only strips receivable and certain loans, debt securities, other receivables, and interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitizations can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the holder of the financial asset would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment.  After their initial recording on the balance sheet, financial assets of this type must be subsequently measured at fair value like available-for-sale securities or trading securities.


[1]  FASB Statement No. 140 defines an interest-only strip receivable as the contractual right to receive some or all of the interest due on a bond, mortgage loan, collateralized mortgage obligation, or other interest-bearing financial asset.</label>

A summary of these accounting standards follows.  For further information, see ASC Subtopic 310-40.

A troubled debt restructuring is a restructuring in which a bank, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider.  The restructuring of a loan or other debt instrument (hereafter referred to collectively as a "loan") may include, but is not necessarily limited to:  (1) the transfer from the borrower to the bank of real estate, receivables from third parties, other assets, or an equity interest in the borrower in full or partial satisfaction of the loan (see the Glossary entry for "foreclosed assets" for further information), (2) a modification of the loan terms, such as a reduction of the stated interest rate, principal, or accrued interest or an extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, or (3) a combination of the above.  A loan extended or renewed at a stated interest rate equal to the current interest rate for new debt with similar risk is not to be reported as a restructured troubled loan.

The recorded amount of a loan is the loan balance adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount and unamortized loan fees or costs, less any amount previously charged off, plus recorded accrued interest.

All loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring, including both commercial and retail loans, must be evaluated for impairment under ASC Topic 310, Receivables (formerly FASB Statement No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," as amended).  Accordingly, a bank should measure any loss on the restructuring in accordance with the guidance concerning impaired loans set forth in the Glossary entry for "loan impairment."  Under ASC Topic 310, when measuring impairment on a restructured troubled loan using the present value of expected future cash flows method, the cash flows should be discounted at the effective interest rate of the original loan, i.e., before the restructuring.  For a residential mortgage loan with a "teaser" or starter rate that is less than the loan's fully indexed rate, the starter rate is not the original effective interest rate.  ASC Topic 310 also permits a bank to aggregate impaired loans that have risk characteristics in common with other impaired loans, such as modified residential mortgage loans that represent troubled debt restructurings, and use historical statistics along with a composite effective interest rate as a means of measuring the impairment of these loans.

See the Glossary entry for "nonaccrual status" for a discussion of the conditions under which a nonaccrual asset which has undergone a troubled debt restructuring (including those that involve a multiple note structure) may be returned to accrual status.

A troubled debt restructuring in which a bank receives physical possession of the borrower's assets should be accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-40.  Thus, in such situations, the loan should be treated as if assets have been received in satisfaction of the loan and reported as described in the Glossary entry for "foreclosed assets."

Despite the granting of some type of concession by a bank to a borrower, a troubled debt restructuring may still result in the recorded amount of the loan bearing a market yield, i.e., an effective interest rate that at the time of the restructuring is greater than or equal to the rate that the bank is willing to accept for a new extension of credit with comparable risk.  This may arise as a result of reductions in the recorded amount of the loan prior to the restructuring (e.g., by charge-offs).  All loans that have undergone troubled debt restructurings and that are in compliance with their modified terms must be reported as restructured loans in Schedule RC-C, part I, Memorandum item 1.  However, a restructured loan that is in compliance with its modified terms and yields a market rate need not continue to be reported as a troubled debt restructuring in this memorandum item in calendar years after the year in which the restructuring took place.

A restructuring may include both a modification of terms and the acceptance of property in partial satisfaction of the loan.  The accounting for such a restructuring is a two step process.  First, the recorded amount of the loan is reduced by the fair value less cost to sell of the property received.  Second, the institution should measure any impairment on the remaining recorded balance of the restructured loan in accordance with the guidance concerning impaired loans set forth in ASC Topic 310.

A restructuring may involve the substitution or addition of a new debtor for the original borrower.  The treatment of these situations depends upon their substance.  Restructurings in which the substitute or additional debtor controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the original borrower, or performs the custodial function of collecting certain of the original borrower's funds, should be accounted for as modifications of terms.  Restructurings in which the substitute or additional debtor does not have a control or custodial relationship with the original borrower should be accounted for as a receipt of a "new" loan in full or partial satisfaction of the original borrower's loan.  The "new" loan should be recorded at its fair value.

A credit analysis should be performed for a restructured loan in conjunction with its restructuring to determine its collectibility and estimated credit loss.  When available information confirms that a specific restructured loan, or a portion thereof, is uncollectible, the uncollectible amount should be charged off against the allowance for loan and lease losses at the time of the restructuring.  As is the case for all loans, the credit quality of restructured loans should be regularly reviewed.  The bank should periodically evaluate the collectibility of the restructured loan so as to determine whether any additional amounts should be charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses or, if the restructuring involved an asset other than a loan, to another appropriate account.</label>

Although each issue of these securities may involve minor differences in terms, under the basic structure of trust preferred securities a corporate issuer, such as a bank holding company, first organizes a business trust or other special purpose entity.  This trust issues two classes of securities:  common securities, all of which are purchased and held by the corporate issuer, and trust preferred securities, which are sold to investors.  The business trust's only assets are deeply subordinated debentures of the corporate issuer, which the trust purchases with the proceeds from the sale of its common and preferred securities.  The corporate issuer makes periodic interest payments on the subordinated debentures to the business trust, which uses these payments to pay periodic dividends on the trust preferred securities to the investors.  The subordinated debentures have a stated maturity and may also be redeemed under other circumstances.  Most trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon the repayment of the debentures.

Trust preferred securities meet the definition of a security in FASB Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."  Because of the mandatory redemption provision in the typical trust preferred security, investments in trust preferred securities would normally be considered debt securities for financial accounting purposes.  Accordingly, regardless of the authority under which a bank is permitted to invest in trust preferred securities, banks should report these investments as debt securities for purposes of these reports (unless, based on the specific facts and circumstances of a particular issue of trust preferred securities, the securities would be considered equity rather than debt securities under Statement No. 115).  If not held for trading purposes, trust preferred securities issued by U.S. business trusts should be reported in Schedule RC-B, item 6.a, "Other domestic debt securities."

The accounting for contracts for the purchase or sale of when-issued securities or other securities that do not yet exist is addressed in FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by FASB Statement No. 149.  Such contracts are excluded from the requirements of Statement No. 133, as amended, as a regular-way security trade only if:

(1) There is no other way to purchase or sell that security;

(2) Delivery of that security and settlement will occur within the shortest period possible for that type of security; and

(3) It is probable at inception and throughout the term of the individual contract that the contract will not settle net and will result in physical delivery of a security when it is issued.

A contract for the purchase or sale of when issued securities may qualify for the regular-way security trade exclusion even though the contract permits net settlement or a market mechanism to facilitate net settlement of the contract exists (as described in Statement No. 133).  A bank should document the basis for concluding that it is probable that the contract will not settle net and will result in physical delivery.

If a when-issued securities contract does not meet the three criteria above, it should be accounted for as a derivative at fair value on the balance sheet (Schedule RC) and reported as a forward contract in Schedule RC-L, item 12.b.  Such contracts should be reported on a gross basis on the balance sheet unless the criteria for netting in FASB Interpretation No. 39 are met.  (See the Glossary entry for "offsetting" for further information.) 

If a when-issued securities contract qualifies for the regular-way security trade exclusion, it is not accounted for as a derivative.  If the bank accounts for these contracts on a trade-date basis, it should recognize the acquisition or disposition of the when-issued securities on its balance sheet (Schedule RC) at the inception of the contract.  If the bank accounts for these contracts on a settlement-date basis, contracts for the purchase of when-issued securities should be reported as "Other off-balance sheet liabilities" in Schedule RC L, item 9, and contracts for the sale of when-issued securities should be reported as "Other off balance sheet assets" in Schedule RC-L, item 10, subject to the existing reporting thresholds for these two items.

Trading in when issued securities normally begins when the U.S. Treasury or some other issuer of securities announces a forthcoming issue.  (In some cases, trading may begin in anticipation of such an announcement and should also be reported as described herein.)  Since the exact price and terms of the security are unknown before the auction date, trading prior to that date is on a "yield" basis.  On the auction date the exact terms and price of the security become known and when issued trading continues until settlement date, when the securities are delivered and the issuer is paid.  If physical delivery is taken on settlement date and settlement date accounting is used, the securities purchased by the bank shall be reported on the balance sheet as held-to-maturity securities in Schedule RC, item 2.a, available-for-sale securities in Schedule RC, item 2.b, or trading assets in Schedule RC, item 5, as appropriate.</label>

	As a matter of sound practice, letters of credit should:

	(1)	be conspicuously labeled as a letter of credit;

	(2)	contain a specified expiration date or be for a definite term;

	(3)	be limited in amount;

	(4)	call upon the issuing bank to pay only upon the presentation of a draft or other documents as specified in the letter of credit and not require the issuing bank to make determinations of fact or law at issue between the account party and the beneficiary; and 

	(5)	be issued only subject to an agreement between the account party and the issuing bank that establishes the unqualified obligation of the account party to reimburse the issuing bank for all payments made under the letter of credit.

	There are four basic types of letters of credit:

	(1)	commercial letters of credit,
	(2)	letters of credit sold for cash,
	(3)	travelers' letters of credit, and
	(4)	standby letters of credit, 

	each of which is discussed separately on the following page.

	A commercial letter of credit is issued specifically to facilitate trade or commerce.  Under the terms of a commercial letter of credit, as a general rule, drafts will  be drawn when the underlying transaction is consummated as intended.

	A letter of credit sold for cash is a letter of credit for which the bank has received funds from the account party at the time of issuance.  This type of letter of credit is not to be reported as an outstanding letter of credit but as a demand deposit.  These letters are considered to have been sold for cash even though the bank may have advanced funds to the account party for the purchase of such letters of credit on a secured or unsecured basis.

	A travelers' letter of credit is issued to facilitate travel.  This letter of credit is addressed by the bank to its correspondents authorizing the correspondents to honor drafts drawn by the person named in the letter of credit in accordance with specified terms.  These letters are generally sold for cash.

	A standby letter of credit is a letter of credit or similar arrangement that:

	(1)	represents an obligation on the part of the issuing bank to a designated third party (the beneficiary) contingent upon the failure of the issuing bank's customer (the account party) to perform under the terms of the underlying contract with the beneficiary, or
	(2)	obligates the bank to guarantee or stand as surety for the benefit of a third party to the extent permitted by law or regulation.

	The underlying contract may entail either financial or nonfinancial undertakings of the account party with the beneficiary.  The underlying contract may involve such things as the customer's payment of commercial paper, delivery of merchandise, completion of a construction contract, release of maritime liens, or repayment of the account party's obligations to the beneficiary.  Under the terms of a standby letter, as a general rule, drafts will be drawn only when the underlying event fails to occur as intended.

For further information, refer to FASB Statement No. 157.

FAS 157 defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. The definition of fair value for an asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants (not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) in the asset's or liability's principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date.  The transaction is assumed to occur based on an exit price notion versus an entry price.

FAS 157 establishes a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs used to measure fair value. The highest priority is given to Level 1 and the lowest priority to Level 3.

Level 1 fair value measurement inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that a bank has the ability to access at the measurement date.  An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Level 2 fair value measurement inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  Depending on the specific factors related to an asset or a liability, certain adjustments to Level 2 inputs may be necessary to determine the fair value of the asset or liability.  If those adjustments are significant to the asset or liability's fair value in its entirety, the adjustments may render the fair value hierarchy classification to a Level 3 fair value measurement rather than a Level 2 fair value measurement.

Level 3 fair value measurement inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Although these inputs may not be readily observable in the market, the fair value measurement objective is, nonetheless, to obtain an exit price for the asset or liability from the perspective of a market participant. Therefore, Level 3 fair value measurement inputs should reflect the bank's own assumptions about the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability and should be based on the best information available in the circumstances.

FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted, provided that the bank has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year, including financial statements or Reports of Condition and Income for an interim period within that fiscal year.  For purposes of these reports, banks must adopt FAS 157 upon the statement's effective date based on their fiscal year, with earlier application permitted consistent with the statement.</label>

The reporting bank may originate a loan by directly negotiating with a borrower or it may purchase a loan or a portion of a loan originated by another lender that directly negotiated with a borrower.  The reporting bank may also sell a loan or a portion of a loan, regardless of the method by which it acquired the loan.

	Loans may take the form of promissory notes, acknowledgments of advance, due bills, invoices, overdrafts, acceptances, and similar written or oral obligations.

	Among the extensions of credit reportable as loans in Schedule RC-C, which covers both loans held for sale and loans that the reporting bank has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, are:

	(1)	acceptances of other banks purchased in the open market, not held for trading;

	(2)	acceptances executed by or for the account of the reporting bank and subsequently acquired by it through purchase or discount;

The statement applies to all types of loans as well as to debt securities (but not to loans or debt securities carried at fair value if the changes in fair value are included in earnings) and to all types of lenders.  For  further information, see FASB Statement No. 91.

A bank may acquire a loan by originating the loan (lending) or by acquiring a loan from a party other than the borrower (purchasing).  Lending, committing to lend, refinancing or restructuring loans, arranging standby letters of credit, syndicating loans, and leasing activities are all considered "lending activities."  Nonrefundable loan fees paid by the borrower to the lender may have many different names, such as origination fees, points, placement fees, commitment fees, application fees, management fees, restructuring fees, and syndication fees, but in this Glossary entry, they are referred to as loan origination fees, commitment fees, or syndication fees.

FASB Statement No. 91 applies to both a lender and a purchaser, and should be applied to individual loan contracts.  Aggregation of similar loans for purposes of recognizing net fees or costs and purchase premiums or discounts is permitted under certain circumstances specified in FASB Statement No. 91 or if the result does not differ materially from the amount that would have been recognized on an individual loan-by-loan basis.  In general, the statement specifies that:

(1) Loan origination fees should be deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield (interest income).  Once a bank adopts FASB Statement No. 91, recognizing a portion of loan fees as revenue to offset all or part of origination costs in the reporting period in which a loan is originated is no longer acceptable.

(2) Certain direct loan origination costs specified in the Statement should be deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as a reduction of the loan's yield.  Loan origination fees and related direct loan origination costs for a given loan should be offset and only the net amount deferred and amortized.

(3) Direct loan origination costs should be offset against related commitment fees and the net amounts deferred except for: (a) commitment fees (net of costs) where the likelihood of exercise of the commitment is remote, which generally should be recognized as service fee income on a straight line basis over the loan commitment period, and (b) retrospectively determined fees, which are recognized as service fee income on the date as of which the amount of the fee is determined.  All other commitment fees (net of costs) shall be deferred over the entire commitment period and recognized as an adjustment of yield over the related loan's life or, if the commitment expires unexercised, recognized in income upon expiration of the commitment.

(4) Loan syndication fees should be recognized by the bank managing a loan syndication (the syndicator) when the syndication is complete unless a portion of the syndication loan is retained.  If the yield on the portion of the loan retained by the syndicator is less than the average yield to the other syndication participants after considering the fees passed through by the syndicator, the syndicator should defer a portion of the syndication fee to produce a yield on the portion of the loan retained that is not less than the average yield on the loans held by the other syndication participants.

(5) Loan fees, certain direct loan origination costs, and purchase premiums and discounts on loans shall be recognized as an adjustment of yield generally by the interest method based on the contractual term of the loan.  However, if the bank holds a large number of similar loans for which prepayments are probable and the timing and amount of prepayments can be reasonably estimated, the bank may consider estimates of future principal prepayments in the calculation of the constant effective yield necessary to apply the interest method.  Once a bank adopts FASB Statement No. 91, the practice of recognizing fees over the estimated average life of a group of loans is no longer acceptable.

(6) A refinanced or restructured loan, other than a troubled debt restructuring, should be accounted for as a new loan if the terms of the new loan are at least as favorable to the lender as the terms for comparable loans to other customers with similar collection risks who are not refinancing or restructuring a loan.  Any unamortized net fees or costs and any prepayment penalties from the original loan should be recognized in interest income when the new loan is granted.  If the refinancing or restructuring does not meet these conditions or if only minor modifications are made to the original loan contract, the unamortized net fees or costs from the original loan and any prepayment penalties should be carried forward as a part of the net investment in the new loan.  The investment in the new loan should consist of the remaining  net investment in the original loan, any additional amounts loaned, any fees received, and direct loan origination costs associated with the transaction.  In a troubled debt restructuring involving a modification of terms, fees received should be applied as a reduction of the recorded investment in the loan, and all related costs, including direct loan origination costs, should be charged to expense as incurred.  (See the Glossary entry for "troubled debt restructurings" for further guidance.)

(7) Deferred net fees or costs shall not be amortized during periods in which interest income on a loan is not being recognized because of concerns about realization of loan principal or interest.

Direct loan origination costs of a completed loan are defined to include only (a) incremental direct costs of loan origination incurred in transactions with independent third parties for that particular loan and (b) certain costs directly related to specified activities performed by the lender for that particular loan.[1]  Incremental direct costs are costs to originate a loan that (a) result directly from and are essential to the lending transaction and (b) would not have been incurred by the lender had that lending transaction not occurred.  The specified activities performed by the lender are evaluating the prospective borrower's financial condition; evaluating and recording guarantees, collateral, and other security arrangements; negotiating loan terms; preparing and processing loan documents; and closing the transaction.  The costs directly related to those activities include only that portion of the employees' total compensation and payroll-related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing those activities for that particular loan and other costs related to those activities that would not have been incurred but for that particular loan.

All other lending-related costs, whether or not incremental, should be charged to expense as incurred, including costs related to activities performed by the lender for advertising, identifying potential borrowers, soliciting potential borrowers, servicing existing loans, and other ancillary activities related to establishing and monitoring credit policies, supervision, and administration.  Employees' compensation and fringe benefits related to these activities, unsuccessful loan origination efforts, and idle time should be charged to expense as incurred.  Administrative costs, rent, depreciation, and all other occupancy and equipment costs are considered indirect costs and should be charged to expense as incurred.

Net unamortized loan fees represent an adjustment of the loan yield, and shall be reported in the same manner as unearned income on loans, i.e., deducted from the related loan balances (to the extent possible) or deducted from total loans in "Any unearned income on loans reflected in items 1-9 above" in Schedule RC-C, part I.  Net unamortized direct loan origination costs shall be added to the related loan balances in Schedule RC-C, part I.  Amounts of loan origination, commitment, and other fees and costs recognized as an adjustment of yield should be reported under the appropriate subitem of item 1, "Interest income," in Schedule RI.  Other fees, such as (a) commitment fees that are recognized during the commitment period or included in income when the commitment expires (i.e. fees retrospectively determined and fees for commitments where exercise is remote) and (b) syndication fees that are not deferred, should be reported as "Other noninterest income" on Schedule RI.


[1]  For purposes of these reports, a bank which deems its costs for these lending activities not to be material and which need not maintain records on a loan-by-loan basis for other purposes may expense such costs as incurred.</label>

For further information, refer to ASC Topic 310.

Each institution is responsible for maintaining an allowance for loan and lease losses (allowance) at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses in its entire portfolio of loans and leases held for investment, i.e., loans and leases that the bank has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff.  ASC Topic 310 sets forth measurement methods for estimating the portion of the overall allowance for loan and lease losses attributable to individually impaired loans.  For the remainder of the portfolio, an appropriate allowance must be maintained in accordance with ASC Subtopic 450-20, Contingencies - Loss Contingencies (formerly FASB Statement No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies").  For comprehensive guidance on the maintenance of an appropriate allowance, banks should refer to the Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses dated December 13, 2006, and the Glossary entry for "allowance for loan and lease losses."  National banks should also refer to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's Handbook for National Bank Examiners discussing the allowance for loan and lease losses.

In general, loans are impaired under ASC Topic 310 when, based on current information and events, it is probable that an institution will be unable to collect all amounts due (i.e., both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement.  An institution should apply its normal loan review procedures when identifying loans to be individually evaluated for impairment under ASC Topic 310.  When an individually evaluated loan is deemed impaired under ASC Topic 310 and is not collateral dependent, an institution must measure impairment using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate (i.e., the contractual interest rate adjusted for any net deferred loan fees or costs, premium, or discount existing at the origination or acquisition of the loan), except that as a practical expedient, an institution may measure impairment based on a loan's observable market price.  As discussed in the following paragraph, the agencies require the impairment of an impaired collateral dependent loan to be measured using the fair value of collateral method.  A loan is collateral dependent if repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment.  A creditor should consider estimated costs to sell, on a discounted basis, in the measurement of impairment if those costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise satisfy the loan.  If the measure of an impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, an impairment should be recognized by creating an allowance for estimated credit losses for the impaired loan or by adjusting an existing allowance with a corresponding charge or credit to "Provision for loan and lease losses."

For purposes of the Reports of Condition and Income, the impairment of an impaired collateral dependent loan must be measured using the fair value of collateral method.  In general, any portion of the recorded investment in an impaired collateral dependent loan (including recorded accrued interest, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized premium or discount) in excess of the fair value of the collateral (less estimated costs to sell, if applicable) that can be identified as uncollectible should be promptly charged off against the allowance for loan and lease losses.

An institution should not provide an additional allowance for estimated credit losses on an individually impaired loan over and above what is specified by ASC Topic 310.  The allowance established under ASC Topic 310 should take into consideration all available information existing as of the Call Report date that indicates that it is probable that a loan has been impaired.  All available information would include existing environmental factors such as industry, geographical, economic, and political factors that affect collectibility.

ASC Topic 310 also addresses the accounting by creditors for all loans that are restructured in troubled debt restructurings involving a modification of terms, except loans that are measured at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value.  According to ASC Topic 310, all loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings are impaired loans.  For guidance on troubled debt restructurings, see the Glossary entry for "troubled debt restructurings."

As with all other loans, all impaired loans should be reported as past due or nonaccrual loans in Schedule RC-N in accordance with the schedule's instructions.  A loan identified as impaired is one for which it is probable that the institution will be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement.  Therefore, a loan that is not already in nonaccrual status when it is first identified as impaired will normally meet the criteria for placement in nonaccrual status at that time.  Exceptions may arise when a loan not previously in nonaccrual status is identified as impaired because its terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring, but the borrower's sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable time prior to the restructuring is consistent with the modified terms of the loan and the loan is reasonably assured of repayment (of principal and interest) and of performance in accordance with its modified terms.  This determination must be supported by a current, well documented credit evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment under the revised terms.  Exceptions may also arise for those purchased credit-impaired loans for which the criteria for accrual of income under the interest method are met as specified in ASC Subtopic 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly AICPA Statement of Position 03-3, "Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer").  Any cash payments received on impaired loans in nonaccrual status should be reported in accordance with the criteria for the cash basis recognition of income in the Glossary entry for "nonaccrual status."  For further guidance, see the Glossary entries for "nonaccrual status" and "purchased credit-impaired loans and debt securities."</label>

To be considered wholly or substantially secured by a lien or liens on real property, the estimated value of the real estate collateral (after deducting any more senior liens) must be greater than 50 percent of the principal amount of the loan at origination.  A loan satisfying the criteria above, except a loan to a state or political subdivision in the U.S., is to be reported as a loan secured by real estate in the Reports of Condition and Income, (1) regardless of whether the loan is secured by a first or a junior lien; (2) regardless of the department within the bank or bank subsidiary that made the loan; (3) regardless of how the loan is categorized in the bank's records; (4) and regardless of the purpose of the financing.  Only in a transaction where a lien or liens on real property (with an estimated collateral value greater than 50 percent of the loan's principal amount at origination) have been taken as collateral solely through an abundance of caution and where the loan terms as a consequence have not been made more favorable than they would have been in the absence of the lien or liens, would the loan not be considered a loan secured by real estate for purposes of the Reports of Condition and Income.  In addition, when a loan is partially secured by a lien or liens on real property, but the estimated value of the real estate collateral (after deducting any more senior liens) is 50 percent or less of the principal amount of the loan at origination, the loan should not be categorized as a loan secured by real estate.  Instead, the loan should be reported in one of the other loan categories used in these reports based on the purpose of the loan.</label>

However, if the reported amounts under settlement date accounting would not be materially different from those under trade date accounting, settlement date accounting is acceptable.  Whichever method a bank elects should be used consistently, unless the bank has elected settlement date accounting and subsequently decides to change to the preferred trade date method.

Under trade date accounting, assets purchased shall be recorded in the appropriate asset category on the trade date and the bank's obligation to pay for those assets shall be reported in Schedule RC-G, item 4, "All other liabilities."  Conversely, when an asset is sold, it shall be removed on the trade date from the asset category in which it was recorded, and the proceeds receivable resulting from the sale shall be reported in Schedule RC-F, item 6, "All other assets."  Any gain or loss resulting from such transaction shall also be recognized on the trade date.  On the settlement date, disbursement of the payment or receipt of the proceeds will eliminate the respective "All other  liabilities" or "All other assets" entry resulting from the initial recording of the transaction.

Under settlement date accounting, assets purchased are not recorded until settlement date.  On the trade date, no entries are made.  Upon receipt of the assets on the settlement date, the asset is reported in the proper asset category and payment is disbursed.  The selling bank, on the trade date, would make no entries.  On settlement date, the selling bank would reduce the appropriate asset category and reflect the receipt of the payment.  Any gain or loss resulting from such transaction would be recognized on the settlement date.</label>

For purposes of the Reports of Condition and Income, all securities within the scope of ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities (formerly FASB Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities"), that a bank has elected to report at fair value under a fair value option with changes in fair value reported in current earnings should be classified as trading securities.  In addition, for purposes of these reports, banks may classify assets (other than securities within the scope of ASC Topic 320 for which a fair value option is elected) and liabilities as trading if the bank applies fair value accounting, with changes in fair value reported in current earnings, and manages these assets and liabilities as trading positions, subject to the controls and applicable regulatory guidance related to trading activities.  For example, a bank would generally not classify a loan to which it has applied the fair value option as a trading asset unless the bank holds the loan, which it manages as a trading position, for one of the following purposes:  (1) for market making activities, including such activities as accumulating loans for sale or securitization; (2) to benefit from actual or expected price movements; or (3) to lock in arbitrage profits.

All trading assets should be segregated from a bank's other assets and reported in Schedule RC, item 5, "Trading assets."  In addition, banks that reported average trading assets (Schedule RC-K, item 7) of $2 million or more in any of the four preceding calendar quarters should detail the types of assets and liabilities in the trading account in Schedule RC-D, Trading Assets and Liabilities, and the levels within the fair value measurement hierarchy in which the trading assets and liabilities fall in Schedule RC-Q, Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis.  A bank's failure to establish a separate account for assets that are used for trading purposes does not prevent such assets from being designated as trading for purposes of these reports.  For further information, see ASC Topic 320.

All trading account assets should be reported at their fair value as defined by ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (formerly FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements"), with unrealized gains and losses recognized in current income.  When a security or other asset is acquired, a bank should determine whether it intends to hold the asset for trading or for investment (e.g., for securities, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity).  A bank should not record a newly acquired asset in a suspense account and later determine whether it was acquired for trading or investment purposes.  Regardless of how a bank categorizes a newly acquired asset, management should document its decision. 

All trading liabilities should be segregated from other transactions and reported in Schedule RC, item 15, "Trading liabilities."  The trading liability account includes the fair value of derivative contracts held for trading that are in loss positions and short positions arising from sales of securities and other assets that the bank does not own.  (See the Glossary entry for "short position.")  Trading account liabilities should be reported at fair value as defined by ASC Topic 820 with unrealized gains and losses recognized in current income in a manner similar to trading account assets.

Given the nature of the trading account, transfers into or from the trading category should be rare.  Transfers between a trading account and any other account of the bank must be recorded at fair value at the time of the transfer.  For a security transferred from the trading category, the unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of the transfer will already have been recognized in earnings and should not be reversed.  For a security transferred into the trading category, the unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of the transfer should be recognized in earnings.</label>

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-line-771039_lbl_341" xml:lang="en">A banker's acceptance, for purposes of these reports, is a draft or bill of exchange that has been drawn on and accepted by a banking institution (the "accepting bank") or its agent for payment by that institution at a future date that is specified in the instrument.  Funds are advanced to the drawer of the acceptance by the discounting of the accepted draft either by the accepting bank or by others; the accepted draft is negotiable and may be sold and resold subsequent to its original discounting. At the maturity date specified, the holder or owner of the acceptance at that date, who has advanced funds either by initial discount or subsequent purchase, presents the accepted draft to the accepting bank for payment.

The accepting bank has an unconditional obligation to put the holder in funds (to pay the holder the face amount of the draft) on presentation on the specified date.  The account party (customer) has an unconditional obligation to put the accepting bank in funds at or before the maturity date specified in the instrument.

The following description covers the treatment in the Report of Condition of (1) acceptances that have been executed by the reporting bank, that is, those drafts that have been drawn on and accepted by it; (2) "participations" in acceptances, that is, "participations" in the accepting bank's obligation to put the holder of the acceptance in funds at maturity, or participations in the accepting bank's risk of loss in the event of default by the account party; and (3) acceptances owned by the reporting bank, that is, those acceptances - whether executed by the reporting bank or by others - that the bank has discounted or purchased.

(1) Acceptances executed by the reporting bank - With the exceptions described below, the accepting bank must report on its balance sheet the full amount of the acceptance in both (1) the liability item, "Other liabilities" (Schedule RC, item 20), reflecting the accepting bank's obligation to put the holder of the acceptance in funds at maturity, and (2) the asset item, "Other assets" (Schedule RC, item 11), reflecting the account party's liability to put the accepting bank in funds at or before maturity.  The acceptance liability and acceptance asset must also be reported in both Schedule RC-G, item 4, "All other liabilities," and Schedule RC-F, item 6, "All other assets," respectively.

Exceptions to the mandatory reporting by the accepting bank of the full amount of all outstanding drafts accepted by the reporting bank in both "Other liabilities" (Schedule RC, item 20) and "Other assets" (Schedule RC, item 11) on the balance sheet of the Consolidated Report of Condition occur in the following situations:

   (a) One exception occurs in situations where the accepting bank acquires - through initial discounting or subsequent purchase - and holds its own acceptance (i.e., a draft that it has itself accepted).  In this case, the reporting bank's own acceptances that are held by it should not be reported in the "Other liabilities" and "Other assets" items noted above.  The bank's holdings of its own acceptances should be reported in "Loans and leases held for sale" (Schedule RC, item 4.a), "Loans and leases, net of unearned income" (Schedule RC, item 4.b), or "Trading assets" (Schedule RC, item 5), as appropriate.

   (b) Another exception occurs in situations where the account party anticipates its liability to the reporting bank on an acceptance outstanding by making a payment to the bank that reduces the customer's liability in advance of the maturity of the acceptance.  In this case, the reporting bank should decrease "Other assets" (Schedule RC, item 11) by the amount of such prepayment; the prepayment will not affect the bank's "Other liabilities" (Schedule RC, item 20), which would continue to reflect the full amount of the acceptance until the bank has repaid the holder of the acceptance at the maturity date specified in the instrument.  If the account party's payment to the accepting bank before the maturity date is not for the purpose of immediate reduction of its indebtedness to the reporting bank or if receipt of the payment does not immediately reduce or extinguish that indebtedness, such advance payment will not reduce item 11 of Schedule RC but should be reflected in the bank's deposit liabilities.

In all situations other than these two exceptions just described, the accepting bank must report the full amount of its acceptances in "Other liabilities" (Schedule RC, item 20) and in "Other assets" (Schedule RC, item 11).  There are no other circumstances in which the accepting bank can report as a balance sheet liability anything less than the full amount of the obligation to put the holder of the acceptance in funds at maturity.  Moreover, there are no circumstances in which the reporting bank can net its acceptance assets against its acceptance liabilities.

NOTE:  The amount of a reporting member (both national and state) bank's acceptances that are subject to statutory limitations on eligible acceptances as set forth in federal statute 12 USC 372 and in Federal Reserve regulation 12 CFR Part 250 may differ from the required reporting of acceptances on the balance sheet of the Consolidated Report of Condition, as described above. These differences are mainly attributable to ineligible acceptances, to participations in the reporting bank's acceptances conveyed to others, to participations acquired by the reporting bank in other banks' acceptances, and to the effect of the consolidation of subsidiaries in the Report of Condition.

(2) "Participations" in acceptances - The general requirement for the accepting bank to report on its balance sheet the full amount of the total obligation to put the holder of the acceptance in funds applies also, in particular, to any situation in which the accepting bank enters into any kind of arrangement with others for the purpose of having the latter share, or participate, in the obligation to put the holder of the acceptance in funds at maturity or in the risk of loss in the event of default on the part of the account party.[1]  In any such sharing arrangement or participation agreement    regardless of its form or its contract provisions, regardless of the terminology (e.g., "funded," "risk," "unconditional," or "contingent") used to describe it and the relationships under it, regardless of whether it is described as a participation in the customer's liability or in the accepting bank's obligation or in the risk of default by the account party, and regardless of the system of debits and credits used by the accepting bank to reflect the participation arrangement    the existence of the participation or other agreement does not reduce the accepting bank's obligation to honor the full amount of the acceptance at maturity nor change the requirement for the accepting bank to report the full amount of the acceptance in the liability and asset items described above.

The existence of such participations is not to be recorded on the balance sheet (Schedule RC) of the accepting bank that conveys shares in its obligation to put the holder of the acceptance in funds or shares in its risk of loss in the event of default on the part of the account party, and similarly is not to be recorded on the balance sheets (Schedule RC) of the other banks that are party to, or acquire, such participations.  However, in such cases of agreements to participate, the nonaccepting bank acquiring the participation will report the participation in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 17, "All other off-balance sheet liabilities."  This same reporting treatment applies to a bank that acquires a participation in an acceptance of another (accepting) bank and subsequently conveys the participation to others and to a bank that acquires such a participation.  Moreover, the bank that both acquires and conveys a participation in another bank's acceptance must report the amount of the participation in the "All other off-balance sheet liabilities" item in Schedule RC-R, Part II.

(3) Acceptances owned by the reporting bank - The treatment of acceptances owned or held by the reporting bank (whether acquired by initial discount or subsequent purchase) depends upon whether the acceptances are held for trading, for sale, or in portfolio and upon whether the acceptances held have been accepted by the reporting bank or by other banks.

All acceptances held for trading by the reporting bank (whether acceptances of the reporting bank or of other banks) are to be reported in Schedule RC, item 5, "Trading assets."  Banks that must complete Schedule RC-D, Trading Assets and Liabilities, should report other banks' acceptances held for trading in item 6.d, "Other loans," and its own acceptances held for trading according to the account party of the draft, generally in item 6.b, "Commercial and industrial loans," or item 6.d, "Other loans," as appropriate.  

The reporting bank's holdings of acceptances other than those held for trading (whether acceptances of the reporting bank or of other banks) are to be reported in Schedule RC, item 4.a, "Loans and leases held for sale," or in item 4.b, "Loans and leases, net of unearned income," as appropriate, and in Schedule RC-C, part I, "Loans and Lease financing receivables."

In Schedule RC-C, part I, the reporting bank's holdings of other banks' acceptances, other than those held for trading, are to be reported in "Loans to depository institutions and acceptances of other banks" (item 2).  On the other hand, the bank's holdings of its own acceptances, other than those held for trading, are to be reported in Schedule RC-C, part I, according to the account party of the draft.  Thus, holdings of own acceptances for which the account parties are commercial or industrial enterprises are to be reported in Schedule RC-C, part I, in "Commercial and industrial loans" (item 4); holdings of own acceptances for which the account parties are other banks (e.g., in connection with the refinancing of another acceptance or for the financing of dollar exchange) are to be reported in Schedule RC C, part I, in "Loans to depository institutions and acceptances of other banks" (item 2); and holdings of own acceptances for which the account parties are foreign governments or official institutions (e.g., for the financing of dollar exchange) are to be reported in Schedule RC C, part I, "Loans to foreign governments and official institutions" (item 7).

The difference in treatment between holdings of own acceptances and holdings of other banks' acceptances reflects the fact that, for other banks' acceptances, the holding bank's immediate claim is on the accepting bank, regardless of the account party or of the purpose of the loan.  On the other hand, for its holdings of its own acceptances, the bank's immediate claim is on the account party named in the accepted draft.

If the account party prepays its acceptance liability on an acceptance of the reporting bank that is held by the reporting bank (in the held-for-sale account, in the loan portfolio, or as trading assets) so as to immediately reduce its indebtedness to the reporting bank, the recording of the holding - in "Commercial and industrial loans," "Loans to depository institutions and acceptances of other banks," or "Trading assets," as appropriate - is reduced by the prepayment.


[1]  This discussion does not deal with participations in holdings of bankers acceptances, which are reportable as loans.  Such participations are treated like any participations in loans as described in the Glossary entry for "transfers of financial assets.</label>

According to this technical bulletin, only the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract as of the balance sheet date should be reported as an asset.  This amount is the cash surrender value reported to the institution by the insurance carrier less any applicable surrender charges not reflected by the insurance carrier in the reported cash surrender value, i.e., the net cash surrender value.  Because there is no right of offset, an investment in bank-owned life insurance should be reported as an asset separately from any related deferred compensation liability.

The net cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance policies as of the report date should be reported on the balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 11, "Other assets," and in Schedule RC-F, item 5, "Life insurance assets."  The net earnings (losses) on or the net increases (decreases) in the net cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance should be reported in the income statement in Schedule RI, item 5.l, "Other noninterest income."  Alternatively, the gross earnings (losses) on or increases (decreases) in net cash surrender value may be reported in Schedule RI, item 5.l, and the life insurance policy expenses may be reported in Schedule RI, Item 7.d, "Other noninterest expense." If the absolute value of the earnings (losses) on or the increases (decreases) in the net cash surrender value that are reported in Schedule RI, item 5.l, "Other noninterest income," are greater than $25,000 and exceed 3 percent of "Other noninterest income," this amount should be reported in Schedule RI-E, item 1.b.</label>

Some report items call for one set of these categories and other items call for the other set.  The distinctions center around the inclusion or exclusion of foreign branches of U.S. banks and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  For purposes of describing the office location of banks as customers of the reporting bank, the term "United States" covers the 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories and possessions.  (This is in contrast to the usage with respect to the offices of the reporting bank, where U.S. domiciled Edge and Agreement subsidiaries and IBFs are included in "foreign" offices.  Furthermore, for banks chartered and headquartered in the 50 states of the United States and the District of Columbia, offices of the reporting bank in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions are also included in "foreign" offices, but, for banks chartered and headquartered in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions, offices of the reporting bank in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions are included in "domestic" offices.)

U.S. banks - The term "U.S. banks" covers both the U.S. and foreign branches of banks chartered and headquartered in the U.S. (including U.S.-chartered banks owned by foreigners), but excluding U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  On the other hand, the term "banks in the U.S." or "commercial banks in the U.S." (the institutional coverage of which is described in detail later in this entry) covers the U.S. offices of U.S. banks (including their IBFs) and the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, but excludes the foreign branches of U.S. banks.

Foreign banks - Similarly, the term "foreign banks" covers all branches of banks chartered and headquartered in foreign countries (including foreign banks owned by U.S. nationals and institutions), including their U.S.-domiciled branches and agencies, but excluding the foreign branches of U.S. banks.  In contrast, the term "banks in foreign countries" covers foreign-domiciled branches of banks, including the foreign branches of U.S. banks, but excluding the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-line-771044_lbl_346" xml:lang="en">An institution may receive cash or a note receivable as a contribution to its equity capital.  The transaction may be a sale of capital stock or a contribution to paid in capital (surplus), both of which are referred to hereafter as capital contributions.  The accounting for capital contributions in the form of notes receivable is set forth in ASC Subtopic 505-10, Equity - Overall (formerly EITF Issue No. 85-1, "Classifying Notes Received for Capital Stock") and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (Topic 4.E., Receivables from Sale of Stock, in the Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins).  This Glossary entry does not address other forms of capital contributions, for example, nonmonetary contributions to equity capital such as a building.  
	
A capital contribution of cash should be recorded in an institution's financial statements and Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income when received.  Therefore, a capital contribution of cash prior to a quarter-end report date should be reported as an increase in equity capital in the institution's reports for that quarter (in Schedule RI-A, item 5 or 11, as appropriate).  A contribution of cash after quarter-end should not be reflected as an increase in the equity capital of an earlier reporting period.

When an institution receives a note receivable rather than cash as a capital contribution, ASC Subtopic 505-10 states that it is generally not appropriate to report the note as an asset.  As a consequence, the predominant practice is to offset the note and the capital contribution in the equity capital section of the balance sheet, i.e., the note receivable is reported as a reduction of equity capital.  In this situation, the capital stock issued or the contribution to paid-in capital should be reported in Schedule RC, item 23, 24, or 25, as appropriate, and the note receivable should be reported as a deduction from equity capital in Schedule RC, item 26.c, "Other equity capital components."  No net increase in equity capital should be reported in Schedule RI-A, Changes in Bank Equity Capital.  In addition, when a note receivable is offset in the equity capital section of the balance sheet, accrued interest receivable on the note also should be offset in equity (and reported as a deduction from equity capital in Schedule RC, item 26.c), consistent with the guidance in ASC Subtopic 505-10.  Because a nonreciprocal transfer from an owner or another party to an institution does not typically result in the recognition of income or expense, the accrual of interest on a note receivable that has been reported as a deduction from equity capital should be reported as additional paid-in capital rather than interest income.

However, ASC Subtopic 505-10 provides that an institution may record a note received as a capital contribution as an asset, rather than a reduction of equity capital, only if the note is collected in cash "before the financial statements are issued."  The note receivable must also satisfy the existence criteria described below, along with any applicable laws and regulations.[1]  When these conditions are met, the note receivable should be reported separately from an institution's other loans and receivables in Schedule RC-F, item 6, "All other assets," and individually itemized and described in accordance with the instructions for item 6, if appropriate.  

For purposes of these reports, the financial statements are considered issued at the earliest of the following dates:

(1)  The submission deadline for the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (30 calendar days after the quarter-end report date, except for an institution that has more than one foreign office, other than a "shell" branch or an International Banking Facility, for which the deadline is 35 calendar days after quarter-end);
(2)  Any other public financial statement filing deadline to which the institution or its parent holding company is subject; or
(3)  The actual filing date of the institution's public financial reports, including the filing of its Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income or a public securities filing by the institution or its parent holding company. 

To be reported as an asset, rather than a reduction of equity capital, as of a quarter-end report date, a note received as a capital contribution (that is collected in cash as described above) must meet the definition of an asset under generally accepted accounting principles by satisfying all of the following existence criteria:

(1)  There must be written documentation providing evidence that the note was contributed to the institution prior to the quarter-end report date by those with authority to make such a capital contribution on behalf of the issuer of the note (e.g., if the contribution is by the institution's parent holding company, those in authority would be the holding company's board of directors or its chief executive officer or chief financial officer); 
(2)  The note must be a legally binding obligation of the issuer to fund a fixed and stated dollar amount by a specified date; and 
(3)  The note must be executed and enforceable before quarter-end.

Although an institution's parent holding company may have a general intent to, or may have entered into a capital maintenance agreement with the institution that calls for it to, maintain the institution's capital at a specified level, this general intent or agreement alone would not constitute evidence that a note receivable existed at quarter-end.  Furthermore, if a note receivable for a capital contribution obligates the note issuer to pay an amount that is variable or otherwise not specifically stated, the institution must offset the note and equity capital.  Similarly, an obligor's issuance of several notes having fixed face amounts, taken together, would be considered a single note receivable having a variable payment amount, which would require all the notes to be offset in equity capital as of the quarter-end report date.

ASC Topic 715 requires an institution that sponsors a single-employer defined benefit postretirement plan to recognize the funded status of each such plan on its balance sheet.  The funded status of a benefit plan is measured as of the end of an institution's fiscal year as the difference between plan assets at fair value (with limited exceptions) and the benefit obligation.  An overfunded plan is recognized as an asset, which should be reported in Schedule RC-F, item 6, "All other assets," while an underfunded plan is recognized as a liability, which should be reported in Schedule RC-G, item 4, "All other liabilities."  

An institution should measure the net period benefit cost of a defined benefit plan for a reporting period in accordance with ASC Subtopic 715-30 (formerly FASB Statement No. 87) for pension plans and ASC Subtopic 715-60 (formerly FASB Statement No. 106) for other postretirement benefit plans.  This cost should be reported in Schedule RI, item 7.a, "Salaries and employee benefits."  However, an institution must recognize certain gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that arise on a defined benefit plan during each reporting period, net of tax, as a component of other comprehensive income (Schedule RI-A, item 10) and, hence, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) (Schedule RC, item 26.b).  Postretirement plan amounts carried in AOCI are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized in earnings as components of a plan's net periodic benefit cost.  

For further information on accounting for defined benefit postretirement plans, institutions should refer to ASC Topic 715.

Impact on Regulatory Capital - An institution that has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC R, Part I, item 3.a, should reverse the effects on AOCI of ASC Subtopic 715-20 (formerly FASB Statement No. 158) for purposes of reporting and measuring the numerators and denominators for the leverage and risk-based capital ratios.  The intent of the reversal is to neutralize for regulatory capital purposes the effects on AOCI of the application of ASC Subtopic 715-20.  The instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part I, items 9.d and 26, and Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 8, provide guidance on how to report adjustments to Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted and total assets to reverse the effects of applying ASC Subtopic 715-20 for regulatory capital purposes.</label>

Treatment of reciprocal balances with depository institutions - Reciprocal balances arise when two depository institutions maintain deposit accounts with each other, i.e., when a reporting bank has both a "due from" and a "due to" balance with another depository institution. Reciprocal balances between the reporting bank and other depository institutions may be reported on a net basis when a right of setoff exists. Net "due from" balances should be reported in items 1.a and 1.b below, as appropriate. Net "due to" balances should be reported as deposit liabilities in Schedule RC, item 13 below. See the Glossary entry for "offsetting" for the conditions that must be met for a right of setoff to exist. See also the Glossary entry for "reciprocal balances."</label>

On the FFIEC 041, for banks with $300 million or more in total assets, the components of this item will also be included in the appropriate items of Schedule RC-A.

For purposes of these reports, deposit accounts "due from" other depository institutions that are overdrawn are to be reported as borrowings in Schedule RC, item 16, and in Schedule RC-M, item 5.b, except overdrawn "due from" accounts arising in connection with checks or drafts drawn by the reporting bank and drawn on, or payable at or through, another depository institution either on a zero-balance account or on an account that is not routinely maintained with sufficient balances to cover checks or drafts drawn in the normal course of business during the period until the amount of the checks or drafts is remitted to the other depository institution (in which case, report the funds received or held in connection with such checks or drafts as deposits in Schedule RC-E until the funds are remitted).  For further information, refer to the Glossary entry for "overdraft."

Cash items in process of collection include:

(1) Checks or drafts in process of collection that are drawn on another depository institution (or on a Federal Reserve Bank) and that are payable immediately upon presentation in the United States.  This includes:

	(a) Checks or drafts drawn on other institutions that have already been forwarded for collection but for which the reporting bank has not yet been given credit ("cash letters").

	(b) Checks or drafts on hand that will be presented for payment or forwarded for collection on the following business day.

	(c) Checks or drafts that have been deposited with the reporting bank's correspondent and for which the reporting bank has already been given credit, but for which the amount credited is not subject to immediate withdrawal ("ledger credit" items).

However, if the reporting bank has been given immediate credit by its correspondent for checks or drafts presented for payment or forwarded for collection and if the funds on deposit are subject to immediate withdrawal, the amount of such checks or drafts is considered part of the reporting bank's balances due from depository institutions.

(2) Government checks drawn on the Treasurer of the United States or any other government agency that are payable immediately upon presentation and that are in process of collection.

(3) Such other items in process of collection that are payable immediately upon presentation and that are customarily cleared or collected as cash items by depository institutions in the United States, such as:

	(a) Redeemed United States savings bonds and food stamps.

	(b) Amounts associated with automated payment arrangements in connection with payroll deposits, federal recurring payments, and other items that are credited to a depositor's account prior to the payment date to ensure that the funds are available on the payment date.

	(c) Federal Reserve deferred account balances until credit has been received in accordance with the appropriate time schedules established by the Federal Reserve Banks.  At that time, such balances are considered part of the reporting bank's balances due from depository institutions.

	(d) Checks or drafts drawn on another depository institution that have been deposited in one office of the reporting bank and forwarded for collection to another office of the reporting bank.

	(e) Brokers' security drafts and commodity or bill-of-lading rafts payable immediately upon presentation in the U.S.  (See the Glossary entries for "broker's security draft" and "commodity or bill-of-lading draft" for the definitions of these terms.)

Exclude from cash items in process of collection:

(1) Cash items for which the reporting bank has already received credit, provided that the funds on deposit are subject to immediate withdrawal.  The amount of such cash items is considered part of the reporting bank's balances due from depository institutions.

(2) Credit or debit card sales slips in process of collection (report as noncash items in Schedule RC-F, item 6, "All other assets").  However, when the reporting bank has been notified that it has been given credit, the amount of such sales slips is considered part of the reporting bank's balances due from depository institutions.

(3) Cash items not conforming to the definition of in process of collection, whether or not cleared through Federal Reserve Banks (report in Schedule RC-F, item 6, "All other assets").

(4) Commodity or bill-of-lading drafts (including arrival drafts) not yet payable (because the merchandise against which the draft was drawn has not yet arrived), whether or not deposit credit has been given.  (If deposit credit has been given, report as loans in the appropriate item of Schedule RC-C, part I; if the drafts were received on a collection basis, they should be excluded entirely from the bank's balance sheet, Schedule RC, until the funds have actually been collected.)

Unposted debits are cash items in the bank's possession, drawn on itself, that are immediately chargeable, but that have not been charged to the general ledger deposit control account at the close of business on the report date.  All banks including an amount for unposted debits in this item should also see Schedule RC-O, item 1.a or 1.b, "Unposted debits."

Currency and coin include both U.S. and foreign currency and coin owned and held in all offices of the reporting bank, currency and coin in transit to a Federal Reserve Bank or to any other depository institution for which the reporting bank has not yet received credit, and currency and coin in transit from a Federal Reserve Bank or from any other depository institution for which the reporting bank's account has already been charged.  Foreign currency and coin should be converted into U.S. dollar equivalents as of the report date.

Noninterest-bearing balances due from depository institutions include balances due from commercial banks in the U.S., other depository institutions in the U.S. (e.g., credit unions, mutual and stock savings banks, savings or building and loan associations, and cooperative banks), Federal Home Loan Banks, banks in foreign countries, and foreign central banks.  Noninterest-bearing balances include those noninterest-bearing funds on deposit at other depository institutions for which the reporting bank has already received credit and which are subject to immediate withdrawal.  Balances for which the bank has not yet received credit and balances representing checks or drafts for which immediate credit has been given but which are not subject to immediate withdrawal are considered "cash items in process of collection."

Include as noninterest-bearing balances due from depository institutions:

(1) Noninterest-bearing balances due from the reporting bank's correspondents, including amounts that its correspondent is to pass through or already has passed through to a Federal Reserve Bank on behalf of the reporting bank (see the Glossary entry for "pass-through reserve balances" for further discussion).

(2) Noninterest-bearing balances that reflect deposit credit received by the reporting bank because of credit or debit card sales slips that had been forwarded for collection.  (Until credit has been received, report as noncash items in process of collection in Schedule RC-F, item 6, "All other assets.")

(3) Amounts that the reporting bank has actually passed through to a Federal Reserve Bank on behalf of its respondent depository institutions (see the Glossary entry for "pass-through reserve balances" for further discussion).

Exclude from noninterest-bearing balances due from depository institutions:

(1) Balances due from Federal Reserve Banks (report as interest-bearing balances due from depository institutions in Schedule RC, item 1.b).

(2) Deposit accounts "due to" other depository institutions that are overdrawn (report in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 2, "Loans to depository institutions and acceptances of other banks").

(3) All noninterest-bearing balances that the reporting bank's trust department maintains with other depository institutions.</label>

Transactions that are to be reported as federal funds sold may be secured or unsecured or may involve an agreement to resell loans or other instruments that are not securities.

Immediately available funds are funds that the purchasing bank can either use or dispose of on the same business day that the transaction giving rise to the receipt or disposal of the funds is executed.  A continuing contract, regardless of the terminology used, is an agreement that remains in effect for more than one business day, but has no specified maturity and does not require advance notice of the lender or the borrower to terminate.

Report federal funds sold on a gross basis; i.e., do not net them against federal funds purchased, except to the extent permitted under FASB Interpretation No. 39.  Include the fair value of federal funds sold that are accounted for at fair value under a fair value option.

Also exclude from federal funds sold:

(1) Sales of so-called "term federal funds" (as defined in the Glossary entry for "federal funds transactions") (report in Schedule RC, item 4.b, "Loans and leases, net of unearned income").

(2) Securities resale agreements that have an original maturity of one business day or roll over under a continuing contract, if the agreement requires the bank to resell the identical security purchased or a security that meets the definition of substantially the same in the case of a dollar roll (report in Schedule RC, item 3.b, "Securities purchased under agreements to resell").

(3) Deposit balances due from a Federal Home Loan Bank (report as balances due from depository institutions in Schedule RC, item 1.a or 1.b, as appropriate).

(4) Lending transactions in foreign offices involving immediately available funds with an original maturity of one business day or under a continuing contract that are not securities resale agreements (report in Schedule RC, item 4.b, "Loans and leases, net of unearned income").

Assets and other financial instruments held for trading shall be consistently valued at fair value.

Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," all securities within the scope of FASB Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," that a bank has elected to report at fair value under a fair value option with changes in fair value reported in current earnings should be classified as trading securities.  In addition, for purposes of these reports, banks may classify assets (other than securities within the scope of FASB Statement No. 115 for which a fair value option is elected) as trading if the bank applies fair value accounting, with changes in fair value reported in current earnings, and manages these assets as trading positions, subject to the controls and applicable regulatory guidance related to trading activities.  For example, a bank would generally not classify a loan to which it has applied the fair value option as a trading asset unless the bank holds the loan, which it manages as a trading position, for one of the following purposes:  (1) for market making activities, including such activities as accumulating loans for sale or securitization; (2) to benefit from actual or expected price movements; or (3) to lock in arbitrage profits.

Do not include in this item the carrying value of any available-for-sale securities, any loans that are held for sale (and are not classified as trading in accordance with the preceding instruction), and any leases that are held for sale.  Available-for-sale securities are reported in Schedule RC, item 2.b, and in Schedule RC-B, columns C and D.  Loans (not classified as trading) and leases held for sale should be reported in Schedule RC, item 4.a, "Loans and leases held for sale," and in Schedule RC-C.

Trading assets also include derivatives with a positive fair value resulting from the "marking to market" of interest rate, foreign exchange rate, commodity, equity, and credit derivative contracts held for trading purposes as of the report date.  Derivative contracts with the same counterparty that have positive fair values and negative fair values and meet the criteria for a valid right of setoff contained in FASB Interpretation No. 39 (e.g., those contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement) may be reported on a net basis using this item and Schedule RC, item 15, "Trading liabilities," as appropriate.  (See the Glossary entry for "offsetting.")

Include loans and advances to investees and holdings of their bonds, notes, and debentures.

Investments in investees shall be reported using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method the carrying value of the bank's investment in an investee is originally recorded at cost but is adjusted periodically to record as income the bank's proportionate share of the investee's earnings or losses and decreased by the amount of any cash dividends or similar distributions received from the investee. For purposes of these reports, the date through which the carrying value of the bank's investment in an investee has been adjusted should, to the extent practicable, match the report date of the Report of Condition, but in no case differ by more than 93 days from the report date.

NOTE:  12 USC 29 limits the authority of national banks to hold real estate.  State member banks are not authorized to invest in real estate except with the prior approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Federal Reserve Regulation H (12 CFR Part 208).  In certain states, nonmember banks may invest in real estate.

Include as direct and indirect investments in real estate ventures:

(1) Any real estate originally acquired, directly or indirectly, by the bank or a consolidated subsidiary and held for development, resale, or other investment purposes.

(2) Real estate acquisition, development, or construction (ADC) arrangements which are accounted for as direct investments in real estate or real estate joint ventures in accordance with AICPA Practice Bulletin 1, Appendix, Exhibit I, "ADC Arrangements" (FASB Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 310-10, Receivables - Overall).

(3) Real estate originally acquired and held for investment by the bank or a consolidated subsidiary that has been sold under contract and accounted for under the deposit method of accounting in accordance with FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate (FASB Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 360-20, Property, Plant, and Equipment - Real Estate Sales).  Under this method, the seller does not record notes receivable, but continues to report the real estate and any related existing debt on its balance sheet. The deposit method is used when a sale has not been consummated and is commonly used when recovery of the carrying value of the property is not reasonably assured.  If the full accrual, installment, cost recovery, reduced profit, or percentage of completion method of accounting under FASB Statement No. 66 is being used to account for the sale, the receivable resulting from the sale of the real estate should be reported as a loan in Schedule RC C and any gain on the sale should be recognized in accordance with FASB Statement No. 66.

(4) Any other loans secured by real estate and advanced for real estate acquisition, development, or investment purposes if the reporting bank in substance has virtually the same risks and potential rewards as an investor in the borrower's real estate venture.

(5) Investments in subsidiaries that have not been consolidated; associated companies; corporate joint ventures, unincorporated joint ventures, and general partnerships over which the bank exercises significant influence; and noncontrolling investments in certain limited partnerships and limited liability companies (described in the Glossary entry for "equity method of accounting") that are primarily engaged in the holding of real estate for development, resale, or other investment purposes.  The entities in which these investments have been made are collectively referred to as "investees."  Investments by the bank in these investees may be in the form of common or preferred stock, partnership interests, loans or other advances, bonds, notes, or debentures.  Such investments shall be reported using the equity method of accounting.  For further information on the equity method, see the instruction to Schedule RC, item 8, above.

(6) Investments in corporate joint ventures, unincorporated joint ventures, and general partnerships over which the bank does not exercise significant influence and investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies that are so minor that the bank has virtually no influence over the partnership or company, where the entity in which the investment has been made is primarily engaged in the holding of real estate for development, resale, or other investment purposes.</label>

Transactions that are to be reported as federal funds purchased may be secured or unsecured or may involve an agreement to repurchase loans or other instruments that are not securities.

Immediately available funds are funds that the purchasing bank can either use or dispose of on the same business day that the transaction giving rise to the receipt or disposal of the funds is executed.  A continuing contract, regardless of the terminology used, is an agreement that remains in effect for more than one business day, but has no specified maturity and does not require advance notice of the lender or the borrower to terminate.

Report federal funds purchased on a gross basis; i.e., do not net them against federal funds sold, except to the extent permitted under FASB Interpretation No. 39.  Include the fair value of federal funds purchased that are accounted for at fair value under a fair value option.

Also exclude from federal funds purchased:

(1) Purchases of so-called "term federal funds" (as defined in the Glossary entry for "federal funds transactions") (report in Schedule RC, item 16, "Other borrowed money").

(2) Security repurchase agreements that have an original maturity of one business day or roll over under a continuing contract, if the agreement requires the bank to repurchase the identical security sold or a security that meets the definition of substantially the same in the case of a dollar roll (report in Schedule RC, item 14.b, "Securities sold under agreements to repurchase").

(3) Borrowings from a Federal Home Loan Bank or a Federal Reserve Bank (report those in the form of securities repurchase agreements in Schedule RC, item 14.b, and all other borrowings in Schedule RC, item 16).

(4) Borrowing transactions in foreign offices involving immediately available funds with an original maturity of one business day or under a continuing contract that are not securities repurchase agreements (report in Schedule RC, item 16).

The term "any date during the preceding calendar year" refers to the date of the balance sheet and income statement reported on by the auditor (or the date as of which certain agreed upon procedures were applied to selected records and transactions by the auditor) regardless of the actual date of the commencement of the auditing work (audit, internal control attestation, directors' examination, review, compilation, or specific procedures) and regardless of the date of the report submitted by the auditor.

Exclude from "auditing work performed" any tax or consulting work regardless of whether it was performed by an independent certified public accounting firm or others.

The list of possible external auditing work is structured with the "most comprehensive level," an audit of the bank, as number 1 and the other levels of auditing work in descending order so that "no external audit work" is number 9.

Banks may be assisted in determining the level of auditing work performed by reviewing the type of report received from the auditor: 

	(a) If the bank or parent holding company has external auditing work performed by a certified public accounting firm and the report of the auditor:

	Begins				"We have examined . . ." or
					"We have audited  . . ."
	and

	The final paragraph begins	"In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above . . ." or 
					"In our opinion, the balance sheet referred to above . . ."

	the bank would respond to this item with a "1" if the first sentence of the first paragraph of the report describes the financial statements or the balance sheet of the bank or with a "2" if the first sentence of the first paragraph of the report describes the financial statements or the balance sheet of the parent holding company.

	(b) If the report submitted by the auditor:

	Begins				"We have examined management's assertion . . . maintained effective internal control over financial reporting . . .,"
	and 

	The final paragraph states	"In our opinion . . ."

	the bank would respond to this item with a "3."

	(c) If the report submitted by the auditor:

	Begins				"We have applied certain procedures to selected records and transactions . . .,"

	The second paragraph includes	"We do not express an opinion, . . ."

	and 

	The next to last paragraph states	"Had we performed additional procedures . . . other matters may have come to our attention . . . "

	the bank would respond with:

		(i) a "4" if this auditing work was performed by a certified public accounting firm for the Board of Directors as a directors' examination; 

		(ii) a "5" if this auditing work was performed by any other firm (e.g., a consulting firm, another banking organization) for the Board of Directors as a directors' examination; or  

		(iii) a "8" if management otherwise engaged the auditor to perform specified auditing work (excluding tax or consulting work) but this auditing work did not constitute a directors' examination.

	(d) If the report submitted by the auditor:

	Begins				"We have reviewed . . . ,"

	The second paragraph states	"A review consists principally of inquiries . . . ,"

	and

	The final paragraph begins	"Based on our review . . ."

	the bank would respond to this item with a "6."

	(e) If the report submitted by the auditor:

	Begins				"We have compiled . . ."

	and

	The second paragraph begins	"A compilation is limited to presenting . . . "

	the bank would respond to this item with a "7."

	An "independent external auditor" is an auditor who at no time during the year:

		(1) was an employee of the bank;

		(2) performed the bank's bookkeeping or maintained the bank's accounting records;

		(3) was dependent on the bank for his livelihood nor was the bank such a significant client that the loss of that client would jeopardize his livelihood; nor 

		(4) held the bank's securities or was indebted to the bank beyond those types of loans permitted under applicable professional standards.</label>

			(4)	Reserve for contingencies    includes amounts set aside for possible unforeseen or indeterminate liabilities not otherwise reflected on the bank's books and not covered by insurance. This reserve may include, for example, reserves set up to provide for possible losses which the bank may sustain because of lawsuits, the deductible amount under the bank's blanket bond, defaults on obligations for which the bank is contingently liable, or other claims against the bank.  A reserve for contingencies represents a segregation of retained earnings.  It should not include any element of known losses or of any probable incurred losses the amount of which can be estimated with reasonable accuracy (see the Glossary entry for "loss contingencies" for additional information).

Exclude from retained earnings:	 
		
			(1)	Any portion of the proceeds received from the sale of common stock in excess of its par or stated value (report in Schedule RC, item 25).

			(2)	Any portion of the proceeds received from the sale of preferred stock in excess of its par or stated value (report in Schedule RC, item 19 or 23, as appropriate).

			(3)	"Reserves" that reduce the related asset balances such as valuation allowances (e.g., the allowance for loan and lease losses), reserves for depreciation, and reserves for bond premiums.

"Other comprehensive income" refers to revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income but excluded from net income.  

Items of accumulated other comprehensive income include:
			
	(1)  Net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities (including debt securities transferred into the available-for-sale category from the held-to-maturity category), i.e., the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the reporting bank's available-for-sale securities (excluding any available-for-sale securities previously written down as other-than-temporarily impaired).[1]  For most institutions, all "securities," as that term is defined in ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities (formerly FASB Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities"), that are designated as "available-for-sale" will be reported as "Available-for-sale securities" in Schedule RC, item 2.b, and in Schedule RC-B, columns C and D.  However, an institution may have certain assets that fall within the definition of "securities" in ASC Topic 320 (e.g., nonrated industrial development obligations) that it has designated as "available-for-sale" and reports in a balance sheet category other than "Securities" (e.g., "Loans and lease financing receivables") for purposes of the Report of Condition.  These "available-for-sale" assets must be carried on the Report of Condition balance sheet at fair value rather than amortized cost and the difference between these two amounts, net of tax effects, also must be included in this item.

	(2)  The unamortized balance of the unrealized holding gain (loss) that existed at the date of transfer of a debt security transferred into the held to maturity category from the available for sale category.  Consistent with ASC Topic 320, when a debt security is transferred from the available-for-sale category into the held-to-maturity category, the unrealized holding gain (loss) at the date of transfer continues to be reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income account, but must be amortized over the remaining life of the security as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the amortization of any premium or discount.

	(3)  The unaccreted portion of other-than-temporary impairment losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities that was not recognized in earnings in accordance with ASC Topic 320, plus the accumulated amount of subsequent decreases (if not other-than-temporary impairment losses) or increases in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities previously written down as other-than-temporarily impaired.  

	(4)  Accumulated net gains (losses) on derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges,[2] i.e., the effective portion[3] of the accumulated change in fair value (gain or loss) on derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended).

	Under ASC Topic 815, an institution that elects to apply hedge accounting must exclude from net income the effective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge and record it on the balance sheet in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity capital.  The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge must be reported in earnings.  The component of accumulated other comprehensive income associated with a transaction hedged in a cash flow hedge should be adjusted each reporting period to a balance that reflects the lesser (in absolute amounts) of:

	(a)  The cumulative gain (loss) on the derivative from inception of the hedge, less (i) amounts excluded consistent with the institution's defined risk management strategy and (ii) the derivative's gains (losses) previously reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings to offset the hedged transaction, or

	(b)  The portion of the cumulative gain (loss) on the derivative necessary to offset the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction from inception of the hedge less the derivative's gains (losses) previously reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.

	 Accordingly, the amount reported in this item should reflect the sum of the adjusted balance (as described above) of the cumulative gain (loss) for each derivative designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge.  These amounts will be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings (for example, when a hedged variable-rate interest receipt on a loan is accrued or when a forecasted sale occurs).
	
	(5)  Foreign currency translation adjustments and gains (losses) on certain foreign currency transactions accumulated in accordance with ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters (formerly FASB Statement No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation").  See the Glossary entry for "foreign currency transactions and translation" for further information.

	(6)  The accumulated amounts of gains (losses), transition assets or obligations, and prior service costs or credits associated with single-employer defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost in accordance with ASC Subtopic 715-20, Compensation-Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (formerly FASB Statement No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions"; FASB Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions"; and FASB Statement No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans").


[1]  For example, if the fair value of the reporting institution's available-for-sale securities exceeds the amortized cost of its available-for-sale securities by $100,000 (and the institution has had no other transactions affecting the "net unrealized holding gains (losses)" account), the amount to be included in Schedule RC, item 26.b, must be reduced by the estimated amount of taxes using the institution's applicable tax rate (Federal, state and local).  (See the Glossary entry for "income taxes" for a discussion of "applicable tax rate.")  If the institution's applicable tax rate (Federal, state and local) is 40% and the tax basis of its available-for-sale securities approximates their amortized cost, the institution would include "net unrealized holding gains" of $60,000 [$100,000   (40% x $100,000)] in Schedule RC, item 26.b.  The institution would also have a deferred tax liability of $40,000 that would enter into the determination of the amount of net deferred tax assets or liabilities to be reported in Schedule RC-F, item 2, or Schedule RC-G, item 2.

[2]  Generally, the objective of a cash flow hedge is to link a derivative to an existing recognized asset or liability or a forecasted transaction with exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, e.g., the future interest payments (receipts) on a variable-rate liability (asset) or a forecasted purchase (sale).  The changes in cash flows of the derivative are expected to offset changes in cash flows of the hedged item or transaction.  To achieve the matching of cash flows, ASC Topic 815 requires that the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges initially be reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity capital and subsequently be reclassified into earnings in the same future period or periods that the hedged transaction affects earnings .

[3]  The effective portion of a cash flow hedge can be described as the change in fair value of the derivative that offsets the change in expected future cash flows being hedged.  Refer to ASC Topic 815, for further information.

On the FFIEC 041, report cash items in process of collection and unposted debits in Schedule RC-A, item 1.a, and currency and coin in Schedule RC-A, item 1.b.

Cash items in process of collection include:

(1) Checks or drafts in process of collection that are drawn on another depository institution (or on a Federal Reserve Bank) and that are payable immediately upon presentation in the United States (or, for purposes of the FFIEC 031, in the country where the reporting bank's office which is clearing or collecting the check or draft is located).  This includes:

	(a) Checks or drafts drawn on other institutions that have already been forwarded for collection but for which the reporting bank has not yet been given credit ("cash letters").

	(b) Checks or drafts on hand that will be presented for payment or forwarded for collection on the following business day.

	(c) Checks or drafts that have been deposited with the reporting bank's correspondent and for which the reporting bank has already been given credit, but for which the amount credited is not subject to immediate withdrawal ("ledger credit" items).

However, if the reporting bank has been given immediate credit by its correspondent for checks or drafts presented for payment or forwarded for collection and if the funds on deposit are subject to immediate withdrawal, report the amount of such checks or drafts in Schedule RC-A, item 2, "Balances due from depository institutions in the U.S.," or item 3, "Balances due from banks in foreign countries and foreign central banks."

(2) Government checks drawn on the Treasurer of the United States or any other government agency that are payable immediately upon presentation and that are in process of collection.

(3) Such other items in process of collection that are payable immediately upon presentation and that are customarily cleared or collected as cash items by depository institutions in the United States or in such other country where the reporting bank's office which is clearing or collecting the item is located, such as:

	(a) Redeemed United States savings bonds and food stamps.

	(b) Amounts associated with automated payment arrangements in connection with payroll deposits, federal recurring payments, and other items that are credited to a depositor's account prior to the payment date to ensure that the funds are available on the payment date.

	(c) Federal Reserve deferred account balances until credit has been received in accordance with the appropriate time schedules established by the Federal Reserve Banks.  At that time, such balances should be reported in Schedule RC-A, item 4, "Balances due from Federal Reserve Banks."

	(d) Checks or drafts drawn on another depository institution that have been deposited in one office of the reporting bank and forwarded for collection to another office of the reporting bank.

	(e) Brokers' security drafts and commodity or bill-of-lading drafts payable immediately upon presentation in the U.S.  (See the Glossary entries for "broker's security draft" and "commodity or bill-of-lading draft" for the definitions of these terms.)

Exclude from cash items in process of collection:

(1) Cash items for which the reporting bank has already received credit, provided that the funds on deposit are subject to immediate withdrawal (report in Schedule RC-A, item 2, 3, or 4, below, as appropriate).

(2) Credit or debit card sales slips in process of collection (report as noncash items in Schedule RC-F, item 6, "All other assets").  However, when the reporting bank has been notified that it has been given credit, the amount of such sales slips should be reported in Schedule RC-A, item 2, "Balances due from depository institutions in the U.S.," or item 3, "Balances due from banks in foreign countries and foreign central banks," as appropriate.

(3) Cash items not conforming to the definition of in process of collection, whether or not cleared through Federal Reserve Banks (report in Schedule RC-F, item 6, "All other assets").

(4) Commodity or bill-of-lading drafts (including arrival drafts) not yet payable (because the merchandise against which the draft was drawn has not yet arrived), whether or not deposit credit has been given.  (If deposit credit has been given, report as loans in the appropriate item of Schedule RC-C, part I; if the drafts were received on a collection basis, they should be excluded entirely from the bank's balance sheet, Schedule RC, until the funds have actually been collected.)

Unposted debits are cash items in the bank's possession, drawn on itself, that are immediately chargeable, but that have not been charged to the general ledger deposit control account at the close of business on the report date.

Currency and coin include both U.S. and foreign currency and coin owned and held in all offices of the reporting bank, currency and coin in transit to a Federal Reserve Bank or to any other depository institution for which the reporting bank has not yet received credit, and currency and coin in transit from a Federal Reserve Bank or from any other depository institution for which the reporting bank's account has already been charged.  Foreign currency and coin should be converted into U.S. dollar equivalents as of the report date.</label>

On the FFIEC 031, banks that have more than one office in foreign countries (including offices of consolidated foreign subsidiaries but excluding "shell" branches, offices in Puerto Rico or U.S. territories and possessions, and IBFs) have the option of excluding the smallest of such non-U.S. offices from Memorandum item 2. Such banks may omit the smallest of their offices in foreign countries (other than "shell" branches) when arrayed by total assets provided that the assets of the excluded offices do not exceed 50 percent of the total assets of the bank's offices (excluding "shells") in foreign countries and do not exceed 10 percent of the total consolidated assets of the reporting bank as of the report date. (Note: In determining the total assets of offices in foreign countries eligible for exclusion from these memorandum items, banks should exclude not only "shell" branches but also offices in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions, domestic offices of Edge and Agreement subsidiaries, and IBFs even though these are sometimes referred to as "foreign" offices. Also, the asset totals for all offices in foreign countries should be the component of the total consolidated assets, i.e., should exclude all intrabank transactions.)
		
For purposes of this memorandum item, the following definitions apply:
		
A fixed interest rate is a rate that is specified at the origination of the transaction, is fixed and invariable during the term of the debt security, and is known to both the borrower and the lender. Also treated as a fixed interest rate is a predetermined interest rate which is a rate that changes during the term of the debt security on a predetermined basis, with the exact rate of interest over the life of the debt security known with certainty to both the borrower and the lender when the debt security is acquired.
		
A floating rate is a rate that varies, or can vary, in relation to an index, to some other interest rate such as the rate on certain U.S. Government securities or the "prime rate," or to some other variable criterion the exact value of which cannot be known in advance. Therefore, the exact rate the debt security carries at any subsequent time cannot be known at the time of origination.		

When the rate on a debt security with a floating rate has reached a contractual floor or ceiling level, the debt security is to be treated as "fixed rate" rather than as "floating rate" until the rate is again free to float.
		
Remaining maturity is the amount of time remaining from the report date until the final contractual maturity of a debt security without regard to the security's repayment schedule, if any.
		
Next repricing date is the date the interest rate on a floating rate debt security can next change in accordance with the terms of the contract (without regard to the security's repayment schedule, if any, or expected prepayments) or the contractual maturity date of the security, whichever is earlier.
		
Banks whose records or information systems provide data on the final contractual maturities, next repricing dates, and expected average lives of their debt securities for time periods that closely approximate the maturity and repricing periods specified in Memorandum items 2.a through 2.d (e.g., 89 or 90 days rather than three months, 359 or 360 days rather than 12 months) may use these date to complete Memorandum items 2.a through 2.d. 

For debt securities with scheduled contractual payments, banks whose records or information systems provide repricing data that take into account these scheduled contractual payments, with or without the effect of anticipated prepayments, may adjust these data in an appropriate manner to derive reasonable estimates for the final contractual maturities of fixed rate debt securities (and floating rate debt securities for purposes of Memorandum item 2.c) and the next repricing dates of floating rate debt securities. 
		
Callable fixed rate debt securities should be reported in Memorandum items 2.a, 2.b, and 2.d without regard to their next call date unless the security has actually been called. When fixed rate debt securities have been called, they should be reported on the basis of the time remaining until the call date. Callable floating rate debt securities should be reported in Memorandum items 2.a and 2.b on the basis of their next repricing date without regard to their next call date if the security has not been called. Those that have been called should be reported based on the earlier of their next repricing date or their actual call date.

Fixed rate mortgage pass-through securities (such as those guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) or issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), and certain banks, savings associations, and securities dealers) and fixed rate Small Business Administration (SBA) "Guaranteed Loan Pool Certificates" should be reported on the basis of the time remaining until their final contractual maturity without regard to either expected prepayments or scheduled contractual payments. Floating rate mortgage pass-through securities and SBA "Guaranteed Loan Pool Certificates" should be reported in Memorandum items 2.a and 2.b on the basis of their next repricing date. 

Fixed rate debt securities that provide the reporting bank with the option to redeem them at one or more specified dates prior to their contractual maturity date, so-called "put bonds," should be reported on the basis of the time remaining until the next "put" date. Floating rate "put bonds" should be reported in Memorandum items 2.a and 2.b on the basis of their next repricing date without regard to "put" dates if the bank has not exercised the put. If a "put" has been exercised but the security has not yet been repaid, the "put" bond should be reported based on the earlier of its next repricing date or its scheduled repayment date. 
		
Zero coupon debt securities, including U.S. Treasury bills, should be treated as fixed rate debt securities for purposes of this Memorandum item.</label>

Banks should report based on the most recent average life information obtained within the twelve months preceding the report date. Weighted average life is the dollar-weighted average time in which principal is repaid. For a mortgage-backed security, weighted average life should be based on the prepayment assumptions associated with the pool of loans underlying the security as well as scheduled repayments. Weighted average life is computed by (a) multiplying the amount of each principal reduction by the number of years or months from the date of issuance or the testing date to the date of the principal reduction, (b) summing the results, and (c) dividing the sum by the remaining principal balance as of the date of issuance or the testing date. Because weighted average life should consider expected prepayments, it is not equivalent to contractual maturity. Because it is dollar- and time-weighted, it also is not equivalent to expected final maturity.</label>

In general, structured notes are debt securities whose cash flow characteristics (coupon rate, redemption amount, or stated maturity) depend upon one or more indices and/or that have embedded forwards or options or are otherwise commonly known as "structured notes."  Include as structured notes any asset-backed securities (other than mortgage-backed securities) which possess the aforementioned characteristics.

Structured notes include, but are not limited to, the following common structures:

(1) Floating rate debt securities whose payment of interest is based upon:

    (a)	a single index of a Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) rate or a Cost of Funds Index (COFI), or

    (b) changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  However, exclude from structured notes all U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).

(2) Step-up Bonds.  Step-up securities initially pay the investor an above-market yield for a short noncall period and then, if not called, "step up" to a higher coupon rate (which will be below current market rates).  The investor initially receives a higher yield because of having implicitly sold one or more call options.  A step-up bond may continue to contain call options even after the bond has stepped up to the higher coupon rate.  A multistep bond has a series of fixed and successively higher coupons over its life.  At each call date, if the bond is not called, the coupon rate increases.

(3) Index Amortizing Notes (IANs).  IANs repay principal according to a predetermined amortization schedule that is linked to the level of a specific index (usually the London Interbank Offered Rate -  LIBOR - or a specified prepayment rate).  As market interest rates increase (or prepayment rates decrease), the maturity of an IAN extends, similar to that of a collateralized mortgage obligation.  When the principal payments on these notes are indexed to the prepayment performance of a reference pool of mortgages or a reference mortgage-backed security, but the notes themselves are not collateralized by the mortgages or the mortgage-backed security, the notes are sometimes marketed as Prepayment-Linked Notes.

(4) Dual Index Notes.  These bonds have coupon rates that are determined by the difference between two market indices, typically the CMT rate and LIBOR.  These bonds often have a fixed coupon rate for a brief period, followed by a longer period of variable rates, e.g., 8 percent fixed for two years, then the 10-year CMT rate plus 300 basis points minus three-month LIBOR.

(5) De-leveraged Bonds.  These bonds pay investors according to a formula that is based upon a fraction of the increase or decrease in a specified index, such as the CMT rate or the prime rate.  For example, the coupon might be the 10-year CMT rate multiplied by 0.5, plus 150 basis points.  The de-leveraging multiplier (0.5) causes the coupon to lag overall movements in market yields.  A leveraged bond would involve a multiplier greater than 1.

(6) Range Bonds.  Range bonds (or accrual bonds) pay the investor an above-market coupon rate as long as the reference rate is between levels established at issue.  For each day that the reference rate is outside this range, the bonds earn no interest.  For example, if LIBOR is the reference rate, a bond might pay LIBOR plus 75 basis points for each day that LIBOR is between 3.5 and 5.0 percent.  When LIBOR is less than 3.5 percent or more than 5 percent, the bond would accrue no interest.

(7) Inverse Floaters.  These bonds have coupons that increase as rates decline and decrease as rates rise.  The coupon is based upon a formula, such as 12 percent minus three-month LIBOR.
	   
Exclude from structured notes floating rate debt securities denominated in U.S. dollars whose payment of interest is based upon a single index of a Treasury bill rate, the prime rate, or LIBOR and which do not contain adjusting caps, adjusting floors, leverage, or variable principal redemption.  Furthermore, debt securities that do not possess the aforementioned characteristics of a structured note need not be reported as structured notes solely because they are callable as of a specified date at a specified price.  In addition, debt securities that in the past possessed the characteristics of a structured note, but which have "fallen through" their structures (e.g., all of the issuer's call options have expired and there are no more adjustments to the interest rate on the security), need not be reported as structured notes.

Generally, municipal and corporate securities that have periodic call options should not be reported as structured notes.  Although many of these securities have features similar to those found in some structured notes (e.g., step-ups, which generally remain callable after a step-up date), they are not commonly known as structured notes.  Examples of such callable securities that should not be reported as structured notes include:

(1) Callable municipal and corporate bonds which have single (or multiple) explicit call dates and then can be called on any interest payment date after the last explicit call date (i.e., they are continuously callable).

(2) Callable federal agency securities that have continuous call features after an explicit call date, except step-up bonds (which are structured notes).

The mere existence of simple caps and floors does not necessarily make a security a structured note.  Securities with adjusting caps or floors (i.e., caps or floors that change over time), however, are structured notes.  Therefore, the following types of securities should not be reported as structured notes:

(1) Variable rate securities, including Small Business Administration "Guaranteed Loan Pool Certificates," unless they have features of securities which are commonly known as structured notes (i.e., they are inverse, range, or de-leveraged floaters, index amortizing notes, dual index or variable principal redemption or step-up bonds), or have adjusting caps or floors.

(2) Mortgage-backed securities.</label>

See the Glossary entry for "loan secured by real estate" for the definition of this term.  On the FFIEC 041, all institutions should report in items 1.a.(1) through 1.e.(2) of column B a nine-category breakdown of loans secured by real estate.  On the FFIEC 031, all large institutions and highly complex institutions - as defined for deposit insurance assessment purposes in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-O, Memorandum items 6 through 18 - with foreign offices should report a nine-category breakdown of loans secured by real estate for the consolidated bank in items 1.a.(1) through 1.e.(2) of column A and for domestic offices in items 1.a.(1) through 1.e.(2) of column B; all other institutions with foreign offices should report only the total amount of loans secured by real estate for the consolidated bank in item 1 of column A, but with a nine-category breakdown of these loans for domestic offices in items 1.a.(1) through 1.e.(2) of column B.
   
Include all loans (other than those to states and political subdivisions in the U.S.), regardless of purpose and regardless of whether originated by the bank or purchased from others, that are secured by real estate at origination as evidenced by mortgages, deeds of trust, land contracts, or other instruments, whether first or junior liens (e.g., equity loans, second mortgages) on real estate.	

Include as loans secured by real estate:

(1) Loans secured by residential properties that are guaranteed by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) and extended, collected, and serviced by a party other than the FmHA.

(2) Loans secured by properties and guaranteed by governmental entities in foreign countries.

(3) Participations in pools of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Title I home improvement loans that are secured by liens (generally, junior liens) on residential properties.

Exclude from loans secured by real estate:

(1) Obligations (other than securities and leases) of states and political subdivisions in the U.S. that are secured by real estate (report in Schedule RC C, part I, item 8).

(2) All loans and sales contracts indirectly representing other real estate (report in Schedule RC, item 7, "Other real estate owned").

(3) Loans to real estate companies, real estate investment trusts, mortgage lenders, and foreign non governmental entities that specialize in mortgage loan originations and that service mortgages for other lending institutions when the real estate mortgages or similar liens on real estate are not sold to the bank but are merely pledged as collateral (report in Schedule RC C, part I, item 2, "Loans to depository institutions and acceptances of other banks," or item 9.a, "Loans to nondepository financial institutions," as appropriate).

(4) Bonds issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association or by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation that are collateralized by residential mortgages (report in Schedule RC B, item 2.b, Securities "Issued by U.S. Government-sponsored agencies").

(5) Pooled residential mortgages for which participation certificates have been issued or guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (report in Schedule RC B, item 4.a).

For purposes of this item, "construction" includes not only construction of new structures, but also additions or alterations to existing structures and the demolition of existing structures to make way for new structures.

Also include in this item:

(1) Loans secured by vacant land, except land known to be used or usable for agricultural purposes, such as crop and livestock production (which should be reported in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.b, below, as loans secured by farmland).

(2) Loans secured by real estate the proceeds of which are to be used to acquire and improve developed and undeveloped property.

(3) Loans made under Title I or Title X of the National Housing Act that conform to the definition of construction stated above and that are secured by real estate.

Loans written as combination construction-permanent loans secured by real estate should be reported in this item until construction is completed or principal amortization payments begin, whichever comes first.  When the first of these events occurs, the loans should begin to be reported in the real estate loan category in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1, appropriate to the real estate collateral.  For purposes of these reports, a combination construction-permanent loan arises when the lender enters into a contractual agreement with the original borrower at the time the construction loan is originated to also provide the original borrower with permanent financing that amortizes principal after construction is completed and a certificate of occupancy is obtained (if applicable).  This construction-permanent loan structure is intended to apply to situations where, at the time the construction loan is originated, the original borrower:

* Is expected to be the owner-occupant of the property upon completion of construction and receipt of a certificate of occupancy (if applicable), for example, where the financing is being provided to the original borrower for the construction and permanent financing of the borrower's residence or place of business, or 

* Is not expected to be the owner-occupant of the property, but repayment of the permanent loan will be derived from rental income associated with the property being constructed after receipt of a certificate of occupancy (if applicable) rather than from the sale of the property being constructed.

All construction loans secured by real estate, other than combination construction-permanent loans as described above, should continue to be reported in this item after construction is completed unless and until (1) the loan is refinanced into a new permanent loan by the reporting bank or is otherwise repaid, (2) the bank acquires or otherwise obtains physical possession of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the debt, or (3) the loan is charged off.  For purposes of these reports, a construction loan is deemed to be refinanced into a new permanent loan only if the bank originates:

* An amortizing permanent loan to a new borrower (unrelated to the original borrower) who has purchased the real property, or 

* A prudently underwritten new amortizing permanent loan at market terms to the original borrower - including an appropriate interest rate, maturity, and loan-to-value ratio - that is no longer dependent on the sale of the property for repayment.  The loan should have a clearly identified ongoing source of repayment sufficient to service the required principal and interest payments over a reasonable and customary period relative to the type of property securing the new loan.  A new loan to the original borrower not meeting these criteria (including a new loan on interest-only terms or a new loan with a short-term balloon maturity that is inconsistent with the ongoing source of repayment criterion) should continue to be reported as a "Construction, land development, and other land loan" in the appropriate subitem of Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.a.

(1) Nonfarm property containing 1-to-4 dwelling units (including vacation homes) or more than four dwelling units if each is separated from other units by dividing walls that extend from ground to roof (e.g., row houses, townhouses, or the like).

(2) Mobile homes where (a) state laws define the purchase or holding of a mobile home as the purchase or holding of real property and where (b) the loan to purchase the mobile home is secured by that mobile home as evidenced by a mortgage or other instrument on real property.

(3) Individual condominium dwelling units and loans secured by an interest in individual cooperative housing units, even if in a building with five or more dwelling units.

(4) Housekeeping dwellings with commercial units combined where use is primarily residential and where only 1-to-4 family dwelling units are involved.

Reverse 1-4 family residential mortgages should be reported in the appropriate subitem based on whether they are closed-end or open-end mortgages.  A reverse mortgage is an arrangement in which a homeowner borrows against the equity in his/her home and receives cash either in a lump sum or through periodic payments.  However, unlike a traditional mortgage loan, no payment is required until the borrower no longer uses the home as his or her principal residence. Cash payments to the borrower after closing, if any, and accrued interest are added to the principal balance.  These loans may have caps on their maximum principal balance or they may have clauses that permit the cap on the maximum principal balance to be increased under certain circumstances.  Homeowners generally have one of the following options for receiving tax free loan proceeds from a reverse mortgage:  (1) one lump sum payment; (2) a line of credit; (3) fixed monthly payments to homeowner either for a specified term or for as long as the homeowner lives in the home; or (4) a combination of the above.  

Reverse mortgages that provide for a lump sum payment to the borrower at closing, with no ability for the borrower to receive additional funds under the mortgage at a later date, should be reported as closed-end loans in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.c.(2).  Normally, closed-end reverse mortgages are first liens and would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.c.(2)(a).  Reverse mortgages that are structured like home equity lines of credit in that they provide the borrower with additional funds after closing (either as fixed monthly payments, under a line of credit, or both) should be reported as open-end loans in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.c.(1).  Open-end reverse mortgages also are normally first liens.  Where there is a combination of both a lump sum payment to the borrower at closing and payments after the closing of the loan, the reverse mortgage should be reported as an open-end loan in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.c.(1). 

Exclude loans for 1-to-4 family residential property construction and land development purposes (report in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.a).  Also exclude loans secured by vacant lots in established single-family residential sections or in areas set aside primarily for 1-to-4 family homes (report in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.a).</label>

For purposes of reporting loans in Schedule RC-C, part I, items 1.e.(1) and 1.e.(2), below, the determination as to whether a nonfarm nonresidential property is considered "owner-occupied" should be made upon acquisition (origination or purchase) of the loan.  However, for purposes of determining whether existing nonfarm nonresidential real estate loans (in domestic offices) should be reported as "owner-occupied" when a bank must first begin reporting such loans (in domestic offices) as of March 31, 2007 (or March 31, 2008),[1] the bank may consider the source of repayment either when the loan was acquired or based on the most recent available information.  Once a bank determines whether a loan should be reported as "owner-occupied" or not, this determination need not be reviewed thereafter.

[1] Reporting nonfarm nonresidential real estate loans (in domestic offices) as loans secured by "owner-occupied" properties or by other properties, as appropriate, takes effect:
*March 31, 2007, for (1) all banks with $300 million or more in total assets as of December 31, 2005, or with foreign offices, and (2) banks with less than $300 million in total assets as of December 31, 2005, and domestic offices only whose total construction, multifamily, and nonfarm nonresidential real estate loans (Schedule RC-C, part I, sum of items 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e) as of December 31, 2005, was greater than 150 percent of total equity capital (Schedule RC, item 28) as of December 31, 2005; and
*March 31, 2008, for banks with less than $300 million in total assets as of December 31, 2005, and domestic offices only that do not meet this percentage test.

Seller's interests differ from the securities issued to investors by the securitization structure.

(2) Loans (other than those that meet the definition of a "loan secured by real estate") to nonprofit organizations (e.g., churches, hospitals, educational and charitable institutions, clubs, and similar associations) except those collateralized by production payments where the proceeds ultimately go to a commercial or industrial organization (which are to be reported in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 4).

As set forth in ASC Subtopic 310-40, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (formerly FASB Statement No. 15, "Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings," as amended by FASB Statement No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan"), a troubled debt restructuring is a restructuring of a loan in which a bank, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. For purposes of this Memorandum item, the concession consists of a modification of terms, such as a reduction of the loan's stated interest rate, principal, or accrued interest or an extension of the loan's maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, regardless of whether the loan is secured or unsecured and regardless of whether the loan is guaranteed by the government or by others.

Once an obligation has been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring, it continues to be considered a troubled debt restructuring until paid in full or otherwise settled, sold, or charged off. However, if a restructured obligation is in compliance with its modified terms and the restructuring agreement specifies an interest rate that at the time of the restructuring is greater than or equal to the rate that the bank was willing to accept for a new extension of credit with comparable risk, the loan need not continue to be reported as a troubled debt restructuring in this Memorandum item in calendar years after the year in which the restructuring took place. A loan extended or renewed at a stated interest rate equal to the current interest rate for new debt with similar risk is not considered a troubled debt restructuring. Also, a loan to a third party purchaser of "other real estate owned" by the reporting bank for the purpose of facilitating the disposal of such real estate is not considered a troubled debt restructuring. For further information, see the Glossary entry for "troubled debt restructurings."

Include in the appropriate subitem all loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings as defined above that are in compliance with their modified terms, that is, restructured loans (1) on which all contractual payments of principal or interest scheduled that are due under the modified repayment terms have been paid or (2) on which contractual payments of both principal and interest scheduled under the modified repayment terms are less than 30 days past due.

Exclude from this item (1) those loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings on which under their modified repayment terms either principal or interest is 30 days or more past due and (2) those loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings that are in nonaccrual status under their modified repayment terms. Report such loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings in the category and column appropriate to the loan in Schedule RC-N, items 1 through 8, column A, B, or C, and in Schedule RC-N, Memoranda items 1.a through 1.f, column A, B, or C.

However, exclude those loans and leases that are reported as "nonaccrual" in Schedule RC-N, column C.

The sum of Memorandum items 2.a.(1) through 2.b.(6) plus total nonaccrual loans and leases from Schedule RC-N, sum of items 1 through 8, column C, must equal Schedule RC-C, sum of items 1 through 10.  

On the FFIEC 031, banks that have more than one office in foreign countries (including offices of consolidated foreign subsidiaries but excluding "shell" branches, excluding offices in Puerto Rico or U.S. territories and possessions, and excluding IBFs) have the option of excluding the smallest of such non U.S. offices from Memorandum item 2.  Such banks may omit the smallest of their offices in foreign countries (other than "shell" branches) when arrayed by total assets provided that the assets of the excluded offices do not exceed 50 percent of the total assets of the bank's offices (excluding "shells") in foreign countries and do not exceed 10 percent of the total consolidated assets of the reporting bank as of the report date.  (Note:  In determining the total assets of offices in foreign countries eligible for exclusion from these memorandum items, banks should exclude not only "shel"" branches but also offices in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions, domestic offices of Edge and Agreement subsidiaries, and IBFs even though these are sometimes referred to as "foreign" offices.  Also, the asset totals for all offices in foreign countries should be the component of the total consolidated assets, i.e., should exclude all intrabank transactions.)

For purposes of this memorandum item, the following definitions apply:

A fixed interest rate is a rate that is specified at the origination of the transaction, is fixed and invariable during the term of the loan or lease, and is known to both the borrower and the lender.  Also treated as a fixed interest rate is a predetermined interest rate which is a rate that changes during the term of the loan on a predetermined basis, with the exact rate of interest over the life of the loan known with certainty to both the borrower and the lender when the loan is acquired.  Examples of predetermined rate transactions are:  (1) Loans that carry a specified interest rate, for, say, six months and thereafter carry a rate equal to a specific percentage over the initial rate.  (2) Loans that carry a specified interest rate while the loan amount is below a certain threshold amount but carry a different specified rate above that threshold (e.g., a line of credit where the interest rate is 10% when the unpaid balance of amounts advanced is $100,000 or less, and 8% when the unpaid balance is more than $100,000).

A floating rate is a rate that varies, or can vary, in relation to an index, to some other interest rate such as the rate on certain U.S. Government securities or the bank's"
"prime rate" or to some other variable criterion the exact value of which cannot be known in advance.  Therefore, the exact rate the loan carries at any subsequent time cannot be known at the time of origination. 

When the rate on a loan with a floating rate has reached a contractual floor or ceiling evel, the loan is to be treated as "fixed rate" rather than as "floating rate" until the rate is again free to float.

Remaining maturity is the amount of time remaining from the report date until the final contractual maturity of a loan or lease without regard to the loan's or lease's repayment schedule, if any.

Next repricing date is the date the interest the rate on a floating rate loan can next change in accordance with the terms of the contract (without regard to the loan's repayment schedule, if any, or expected prepayments) or the contractual maturity date of the loan, whichever is earlier.

Banks whose records or information systems provide data on the final contractual maturities and next repricing dates of their loans and leases for time periods that closely approximate the maturity and repricing periods specified in Memorandum items 2.a through 2.c (e.g., 89 or 90 days rather than three months, 359 or 360 days rather than 12 months) may use these data to complete Memorandum items 2.a through 2.c.  

For loans and leases with scheduled contractual payments, banks whose records or information systems provide repricing data that take into account these scheduled contractual payments, with or without the effect of anticipated prepayments, may adjust these data in an appropriate manner to derive reasonable estimates for the final contractual maturities of fixed rate loans and leases (and floating rate loans for purposes of Memorandum item 2.c) and the next repricing dates of floating rate loans.

Loan amounts should be reported net of unearned income to the extent that they have been reported net of unearned income in Schedule RC-C, part I, items 1 through 9.  Leases must be reported net of unearned income.

Fixed rate loans and leases that are past due (with respect to principal or interest) and still accruing should be reported according to the time remaining to final contractual maturity without regard to delinquency status.  Floating rate loans that are past due (with respect to principal or interest) and still accruing should be reported according to their next repricing date without regard to delinquency status.

Report all unplanned overdrafts as fixed rate loans with a remaining maturity of three months or less in Memorandum item 2.b.(1).

Report all leases, net of unearned income, as fixed rate instruments in Memorandum item 2.b according to the amount of time remaining to final contractual maturity without regard to repayment schedules.

Report fixed rate and floating rate loans made solely on a demand basis (i.e., without an alternate maturity date or without repayment terms) as having a remaining maturity or next repricing date of three months or less in Memorandum items 2.a.(1) and 2.b.(1), as appropriate.  In addition, report all fixed rate and floating rate loans made solely on a demand basis as having a remaining maturity of one year or less in Memorandum item 2.c.

Fixed rate demand loans that have an alternate maturity date or repayment terms are to be reported in this Memorandum item according to the amount of time remaining to the alternate maturity date or final payment due date.  Floating rate demand loans that have an alternate maturity date or repayment terms are to be reported according to their next repricing date in Memorandum items 2.a and 2.b, as appropriate.  In addition, fixed rate and floating rate demand loans for which the amount of time remaining to the alternate maturity date or final payment due date is one year or less are to be reported in Memorandum item 2.c.

Fixed rate "Credit cards" and "Other revolving credit plans" are considered to have a remaining maturity of over one year through three years and should be reported in Memorandum item 2.b.(3), regardless of the actual maturity experience or expectation.  Floating rate "Credit cards" and "Other revolving credit plans" (e.g., where the rate varies, or can be varied, periodically) are to be reported in Memorandum item 2.b according to their next repricing date.  Where the bank in its contract with the borrower simply reserves the right to change the interest rate on the "Credit card" or "Other revolving credit," the plan should be considered to have a fixed rate.

Student loans whose interest rate is adjusted periodically by the U.S. Government by means of interest payments that include an amount of "additional interest" should be treated as floating rate loans and should be reported in Memorandum item 2.b according to their next repricing date.

Fixed rate loans that are held by the bank for sale and delivery in the secondary market under the terms of a binding commitment should be reported in Memorandum item 2.a or 2.b, as appropriate, on the basis of the time remaining until the delivery date specified in the commitment.  Floating rate loans that are held by the bank for sale and delivery in the secondary market under the terms of a binding commitment should be reported in Memorandum item 2.a or 2.b, as appropriate, based on the date the interest rates on the loans can next change or the delivery date specified in the commitment, whichever is earlier.  Loans and leases that are held by the bank for sale and delivery in the secondary market under the terms of a binding commitment should be included in Memorandum item 2.c only if they have a remaining maturity of one year or less, i.e., without regard to the delivery date specified in the commitment.

A floating or adjustable rate is a rate that varies, or can vary, in relation to an index, to some other interest rate such as the rate on certain U.S. Government securities, or to some other variable criterion the exact value of which cannot be known in advance.  Therefore, the exact rate the loan carries at any subsequent time cannot be known at the time of origination.  For purposes of this item, even if the rate on a loan with a floating or adjustable rate can no longer float because it has reached a floor or ceiling level, the loan is to be reported in this item as an adjustable rate loan.

Also include in this item amortizing fixed rate loans secured by first liens on 1 4 family residential properties that have original maturities of one year or less and require a balloon payment at maturity.

Negative amortization refers to a method in which a loan is structured so that the borrower's minimum monthly (or other periodic) payment is contractually permitted to be less than the full amount of interest owed to the lender, with the unpaid interest added to the loan's principal balance.  The contractual terms of the loan provide that if the borrower allows the principal balance to rise to a pre-specified amount or maximum cap, the loan payments are then recast to a fully amortizing schedule.  Negative amortization features may be applied to either adjustable rate mortgages or fixed rate mortgages, the latter commonly referred to as graduated payment mortgages (GPMs).

A reverse mortgage is an arrangement in which a homeowner borrows against the equity in his or her home and receives cash either in a lump sum or through periodic payments. However, unlike a traditional mortgage loan, no payment is required until the borrower no longer uses the home as his or her principal residence. Cash payments to the borrower after closing, if any, and accrued interest are added to the principal balance. These loans may have caps on their maximum principal balance or they may have clauses that permit the cap on the maximum principal balance to be increased under certain circumstances. The reverse mortgage market currently consists of two basic types of products: proprietary products designed and originated by financial institutions and a federally-insured product known as a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM).

In some cases, brokered certificates of deposit are issued in $1,000 amounts under a master certificate of deposit issued by a bank to a deposit broker in an amount that exceeds $250,000.  For these so-called "retail brokered deposits," multiple purchases by individual depositors from an individual bank normally do not exceed the applicable deposit insurance limit (currently $250,000), but under current deposit insurance rules the deposit broker is not required to provide information routinely on these purchasers and their account ownership capacity to the bank issuing the deposits.  If this information is not readily available to the issuing bank, these brokered certificates of deposit in $1,000 amounts may be rebuttably presumed to be fully insured brokered deposits and should be reported in Schedule RC-E, Memorandum item 1.c.(1), below.  In addition, some brokered deposits are transaction accounts or money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) that are denominated in amounts of $0.01 and established and maintained by the deposit broker (or its agent) as agent, custodian, or other fiduciary for the broker's customers.  An individual depositor's deposits within the brokered transaction account or MMDA normally do not exceed the applicable deposit insurance limit.  As with retail brokered deposits, if information on these depositors and their account ownership capacity is not readily available to the bank establishing the transaction account or MMDA, the amounts in the transaction account or MMDA may be rebuttably presumed to be fully insured brokered deposits and should be reported in Schedule RC-E, Memorandum item 1.c.(1), below.

The dollar amounts used as the basis for reporting fully insured brokered deposits in Memorandum items 1.c.(1) and 1.c.(2) reflect the deposit insurance limits in effect on the report date.  At present, these limits are $250,000 for "retirement deposit accounts" and $250,000 for other deposit accounts.

The objective of this Memorandum item is not to capture all deposits obtained through the Internet, such as deposits that a bank receives because a person or entity has seen the rates the bank has posted on its own Web site or on a rate-advertising Web site that has picked up and posted the bank's rates on its site without the bank's authorization. Rather, the objective of this Memorandum item is to collect the estimated amount of deposits obtained as a result of action taken by the bank to have its deposit rates listed by a listing service, and the listing service is compensated for this listing either by the bank whose rates are being listed or by the persons or entities who view the listed rates. A bank should establish a reasonable and supportable estimation process for identifying listing service deposits that meet these reporting parameters and apply this process consistently over time. However, for those nonbrokered deposits acquired through the use of a deposit listing service that offers deposit tracking, the actual amount of listing service deposits, rather than an estimate, should be reported.

Exclude from this item all brokered deposits reported in Schedule RC-E, Memorandum item 1.b.

A deposit listing service is a company that compiles information about the interest rates offered on deposits, such as certificates of deposit, by insured depository institutions. A particular company could be a deposit listing service (compiling information about certificates of deposits) as well as a deposit broker (facilitating the placement of certificates of deposit). A deposit listing service is not a deposit broker if all of the following four criteria are met:

(1) The listing service is not involved in placing deposits. Any funds to be invested in deposit accounts are remitted directly by the depositor to the insured depository institution and not, directly or indirectly, by or through the listing service.

(2) The person or entity providing the listing service is compensated solely by means of subscription fees (i.e., the fees paid by subscribers as payment for their opportunity to see the rates gathered by the listing service) and/or listing fees (i.e., the fees paid by depository institutions as payment for their opportunity to list or "post" their rates). The listing service does not require a depository institution to pay for other services offered by the listing service or its affiliates as a condition precedent to being listed.

(3) The fees paid by depository institutions are flat fees: they are not calculated on the basis of the number or dollar amount of deposits accepted by the depository institution as a result of the listing or "posting" of the depository institution's rates.

(4) In exchange for these fees, the listing service performs no services except (A) the gathering and transmission of information concerning the availability of deposits; and/or (B) the transmission of messages between depositors and depository institutions (including purchase orders and trade confirmations). In publishing or displaying information about depository institutions, the listing service must not attempt to steer funds toward particular institutions (except that the listing service may rank institutions according to interest rates and also may exclude institutions that do not pay the listing fee). Similarly, in any communications with depositors or potential depositors, the listing service must not attempt to steer funds toward particular institutions.</label>

The time deposits included in this item will have been reported in Schedule RC-E, Memorandum item 2.b, above.

For purposes of this memorandum item and Schedule RC?E, Memorandum item 4, the following definitions apply:

A fixed interest rate is a rate that is specified at the origination of the transaction, is fixed and invariable during the term of the time deposit, and is known to both the bank and the depositor.  Also treated as a fixed interest rate is a predetermined interest rate which is a rate that changes during the term of the time deposit on a predetermined basis, with the exact rate of interest over the life of the time deposit known with certainty to both the bank and the depositor when the time deposit is acquired.

A floating rate is a rate that varies, or can vary, in relation to an index, to some other interest rate such as the rate on certain U.S. Government securities or the bank's "prime rate," or to some other variable criterion the exact value of which cannot be known in advance.  Therefore, the exact rate the time deposit carries at any subsequent time cannot be known at the time the time deposit is received by the bank or subsequently renewed. 

When the rate on a time deposit with a floating rate has reached a contractual floor or ceiling level, the time deposit is to be treated as "fixed rate" rather than as "floating rate" until the rate is again free to float.

Remaining maturity is the amount of time remaining from the report date until the final contractual maturity of a time deposit.

Next repricing date is the date the interest rate on a floating rate time deposit can next change in accordance with the terms of the contract or the contractual maturity date of the deposit, whichever is earlier.

Banks whose records or information systems provide data on the final contractual maturities and next repricing dates of their time deposits for time periods that closely approximate the maturity and repricing periods specified in this Memorandum item and Schedule RC-E, Memorandum item 4 (e.g., 89 or 90 days rather than three months, 359 or 360 days rather 12 months) may use these data to complete this Memorandum item and Schedule RC-E, Memorandum item 4.  

Time deposits held in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and Keogh Plan accounts should be reported without regard to distribution schedules that may be in effect for funds held in certain depositors' accounts.  Such time deposits should be reported in this Memorandum item and in Schedule RC-E, Memorandum item 4, in the same manner as time deposits not held in IRAs and Keogh Plan accounts.

Noninterest-bearing time deposits should be treated as fixed rate time deposits and reported according to the amount of time remaining until the final contractual maturity in this Memorandum item and in Schedule RC-E, Memorandum item 4.

Fixed rate time deposits that are callable at the option of the issuing bank should be reported according to their remaining maturity without regard to their next call date unless the time deposit has actually been called.  When fixed rate time deposits have been called, they should be reported on the basis of the time remaining until the call date.  Callable floating rate time deposits should be reported on the basis of their next repricing date, without regard to their next call date unless the time deposit has actually been called.  Floating rate time deposits that have been called should be reported on the basis of their next repricing date or their actual call date, whichever is earlier.

Fixed rate time deposits that provide depositors with the option to redeem them at one or more specified dates prior to their contractual maturity date without penalty should be reported according to their remaining maturity without regard to "put" dates if the depositor has not exercised the "put."  If a redemption option has been exercised, however, such deposits should be reported on the basis of the time remaining until the date on which the time deposit will be redeemed.  Floating rate time deposits that provide depositors with redemption options without penalty should be reported on the basis of their next repricing date without regard to the "put" dates if the depositor has not exercised the "put."  If a redemption option has been exercised but the time deposit has not yet been redeemed, the deposit should be reported on the basis of its next repricing date or its scheduled redemption date, whichever is earlier.

In addition, if the bank has issued a master certificate of deposit to a deposit broker in an amount that exceeds $100,000 and under which brokered certificates of deposit are issued in $1,000 amounts (so called "retail brokered deposits"), individual depositors who purchase multiple certificates issued by the bank normally do not exceed the applicable deposit insurance limit (currently $250,000).  Under current deposit insurance rules the deposit broker is not required to provide information routinely on these purchasers and their account ownership capacity to the bank issuing the deposits.

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-line-771501_lbl_803" xml:lang="en">(This item is to be reported for the December 31 report only.)  Report in this item all deposits of states and political subdivisions in the U.S. included in Schedule RC-E, item 3, columns A and C above, which are secured or collateralized as required under state law.  Exclude deposits of the U.S. Government which are secured or collateralized as required under federal law.  Also exclude deposits of trust funds which are secured or collateralized as required under state law unless the beneficiary is a state or political subdivision in the U.S.  The amount reported in this memorandum item must be less than the sum of Schedule RC-E, item 3, column A, and item 3, column C, above.

State law may require a bank to pledge securities (or other readily marketable assets) to cover the uninsured portion of the deposits of a state or political subdivision.  If the bank has pledged securities with a value that exceeds the amount of the uninsured portion of the state or political subdivision's deposits, only the uninsured amount (and none of the insured portion of the deposits) should be reported as a "preferred deposit."  For example, a political subdivision has $450,000 in deposits at a bank which, under state law, is required to pledge securities to cover only the uninsured portion of such deposits ($200,000 in this example).  The bank has pledged securities with a value of $300,000 to secure these deposits.  Only the $200,000 uninsured amount of the political subdivision's $450,000 in deposits, given the currently applicable $250,000 deposit insurance limit, would be considered "preferred deposits."

In other states, banks must participate in a state public deposits program in order to receive deposits from the state or from political subdivisions within the state in amounts that would not be covered by federal deposit insurance.  Under state law in such states, the value of the securities a bank must pledge to the state is calculated annually, but represents only a percentage of the uninsured portion of its public deposits.  Institutions participating in the state program may potentially be required to share in any loss to public depositors incurred in the failure of another participating institution.  As long as the value of the securities pledged to the state exceeds the calculated requirement, all of the bank's uninsured public deposits are protected from loss under the operation of the state program if the bank fails and, therefore, all of the uninsured public deposits are considered "preferred deposits."  For example, a bank participating in a state public deposits program has $1,600,000 in public deposits under the program from four political subdivisions and $700,000 of this amount is uninsured, given the currently applicable $250,000 deposit insurance limit.  The bank's most recent calculation indicates that it must pledge securities with a value of at least $77,000 to the state in order to participate in the state program.  The bank has pledged securities with an actual value of $80,000.  The bank should report the $700,000 in uninsured public deposits as "preferred deposits."</label>

For purposes of this item, consumer deposit account products exclude time deposits.

Your institution should answer "Yes" if it offers one or more transaction account or nontransaction savings account deposit products intended primarily for consumer use even if it also offers other transaction account or nontransaction savings account deposit products intended for use by a broad range of depositors (which may include individuals) rather than being intended, marketed, or presented to the public primarily for individuals for consumer use and regardless of whether the products intended, marketed, or presented to the public primarily for consumer use carry the same terms as other deposit products intended for use by a broad range of depositors (which may include individuals).

Your institution should answer "No" if all of the transaction account and nontransaction savings account deposit products it offers are intended for use by a broad range of depositors (which may include individuals) or by non-consumer depositors and none of these products is intended, marketed, or presented to the public primarily for individuals for personal, household, or family use.

Transaction accounts include demand deposits, negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, automatic transfer service (ATS) accounts, and telephone and preauthorized transfer accounts. Nontransaction savings accounts include money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) and other savings deposits. For the definitions of these types of accounts, see the Glossary entry for "deposits."

Once a customer has opened a deposit account with the reporting institution that is a deposit product intended primarily for individuals for personal, household, or family use, the institution is not required thereafter to review the customer's status or usage of the account to determine whether the transaction account is being used for personal, household, or family purposes. Thus, when reporting the amount of consumer deposit account balances in Memorandum items 6 and 7 of Schedule RC-E, the reporting institution is not required to identify those individual accounts within the population of a particular consumer deposit account product that are not being used for personal, household, or family purposes and remove the balances of these accounts from the total amount of deposit balances held in that consumer deposit account product.</label>

For example, if an institution has a single negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) account deposit product that it offers to all depositors eligible to hold such accounts, including individuals, sole proprietorships, certain nonprofit organizations, and certain government units, the institution would report the entire amount of its NOW accounts in Memorandum item 6.c.

This includes, for example, contractual rights to future interest cash flows that exceed contractually specified servicing fees on financial assets that have been sold.  Report in the appropriate subitem interest-only strips receivable not in the form of a security that are measured at fair value like available-for-sale securities (Footnote: An interest-only strip receivable is not in the form of a security if the strip does not meet the definition of a security in FASB Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.")  Report unrealized gains (losses) on these interest-only strips receivable in Schedule RC, item 26.b, "Accumulated other comprehensive income."

Exclude from this item interest-only strips receivable in the form of a security, which should be reported as available-for-sale securities in Schedule RC, item 2.b, or as trading assets in Schedule RC, item 5, as appropriate.

These equity securities are outside the scope of FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.   An equity security does not have a readily determinable fair value if sales or bid-and-asked quotations are not currently available on a securities exchange registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are not publicly reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations systems or the National Quotation Bureau.  The fair value of an equity security traded only in a foreign market is not readily determinable if that foreign market is not of a breadth and scope comparable to one of the U.S. markets referenced above.

Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values may have been purchased by the reporting bank or acquired for debts previously contracted.

Include in this item: 

(1) Paid-in stock of a Federal Reserve Bank.

(2) Stock of a Federal Home Loan Bank.

(3) Common and preferred stocks that do not have readily determinable fair values, such as stock of bankers' banks and Class B voting common stock of the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac).

(4)  "Restricted stock," as defined in FASB Statement No. 115, i.e., equity securities for which sale is restricted by governmental or contractual requirement (other than in connection with being pledged as collateral), except if that requirement terminates within one year or if the holder has the power by contract or otherwise to cause the requirement to be met within one year.

(5) Participation certificates issued by a Federal Intermediate Credit Bank, which represent nonvoting stock of the bank.

(6) Minority interests held by the reporting bank in any company not meeting the definition of associated company, except minority holdings that indirectly represent bank premises (report in Schedule RC, item 6), other real estate owned (report in Schedule RC, item 7), or investments in real estate ventures (report in Schedule RC, item 9), provided that the fair value of any capital stock representing the minority interest is not readily determinable.  (See the Glossary entry for "subsidiaries" for the definition of associated company.)

(7) Equity holdings in those corporate ventures over which the reporting bank does not exercise significant influence, except equity holdings that indirectly represent bank premises (report in Schedule RC, item 6), other real estate owned (report in Schedule RC, item 7), or investments in real estate ventures (report in Schedule RC, item 9).  (See the Glossary entry for "subsidiaries" for the definition of corporate joint venture.)

Exclude from this item:

(1) Investments in subsidiaries that have not been consolidated; associated companies; corporate joint ventures, unincorporated joint ventures, and general partnerships over which the bank exercises significant influence; and noncontrolling investments in certain limited partnerships and limited liability companies (described in the Glossary entry for "equity method of accounting") (report in Schedule RC, item 8, "Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and associated companies," or item 9, "Direct and indirect investments in real estate ventures," as appropriate).

(2) Preferred stock that by its terms either must be redeemed by the issuing enterprise or is redeemable at the option of the investor (report in Schedule RC-B, item 6, "Other debt securities").</label>

Report in Schedule RC-F, items 6.a through 6.k, each component of all other assets, and the dollar amount of such component, that is greater than $100,000 and exceeds 25 percent of the amount of all other assets reported in this item. Preprinted captions have been provided in Schedule RC-F, items 6.a through 6.h, for reporting the following components of all other assets if the component exceeds this reporting threshold: prepaid expenses, repossessed personal property (including vehicles), derivatives with a positive fair value held for purposes other than trading, retained interests in accrued interest receivable related to securitized credit cards, FDIC loss-sharing indemnification assets, computer software, accounts receivable, and receivables from foreclosed government-guaranteed mortgage loans. For each component of all other assets that exceeds the reporting threshold for which a preprinted caption has not been provided, describe the component with a clear but concise caption in Schedule RC-F, items 6.i through 6.k. These descriptions should not exceed 50 characters in length (including spacing between words).


Include as all other assets:

(1) Prepaid expenses, i.e., those applicable as a charge against earnings in future periods.[1]

(2) Automobiles, boats, equipment, appliances, and similar personal property repossessed or otherwise acquired for debts previously contracted.

(3) Derivative instruments that have a positive fair value that the bank holds for purposes other than trading. For further information, see the Glossary entry for "derivative contracts."

(4) Retained interests in accrued interest receivable related to securitized credit cards.  For further information, see the Glossary entry for "accrued interest receivable related to credit card securitizations."

(5) Accrued interest on securities purchased (if accounted for separately from "accrued interest receivable" in the bank's records).

(6) Cash items not conforming to the definition of "Cash items in process of collection" found in the instruction to Schedule RC, item 1.a.

(7) The full amount (with the exceptions noted below) of customers' liability to the reporting bank on drafts and bills of exchange that have been accepted by the reporting bank, or by others for its account, and are outstanding. The amount of customers' liability to the reporting bank on its acceptances that have not yet matured should be reduced only when: (a) the customer anticipates its liability to the reporting bank on an outstanding acceptance by making a payment to the bank in advance of the acceptance's maturity that immediately reduces the customer's indebtedness to the bank on such an acceptance; or (b) the reporting bank acquires and holds its own acceptance. See the Glossary entry for "bankers acceptances" for further information.

(8) Credit or debit card sales slips in process of collection until the reporting bank has been notified that it has been given credit (report thereafter in Schedule RC, item 1.a, "Noninterest-bearing balances and currency and coin," and, if applicable, in Schedule RC-A, item 2, "Balances due from depository institutions in the U.S.," or item 3, "Balances due from banks in foreign countries and foreign central banks," as appropriate).

(9) Purchased computer software, net of accumulated amortization, and unamortized costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed capitalized in accordance with the provisions of ASC Subtopic 985-20, Software - Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased or Marketed (formerly FASB Statement No. 86, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed").

(10) Bullion (e.g., gold or silver) not held for trading purposes.

(11) Original art objects, including paintings, antique objects, and similar valuable decorative articles (report at cost unless there has been a decline in value, judged to be other than temporary, in which case the object should be written down to its fair value).

(12) Securities or other assets held in charitable trusts (e.g., Clifford Trusts).

(13) Cost of issuing subordinated notes and debentures, net of accumulated amortization.

(14) Furniture and equipment rented to others under operating leases, net of accumulated depreciation.

(15) Ground rents.

(16) Customers' liability for deferred payment letters of credit.

(17) Reinsurance recoverables from reinsurers external to the consolidated bank.

(18) "Separate account assets" of the reporting bank's insurance subsidiaries.

(19) The positive fair value of unused loan commitments (not accounted for as derivatives) that the bank has elected to report at fair value under a fair value option.

(20) FDIC loss-sharing indemnification assets. These indemnification assets represent the carrying amount of the right to receive payments from the FDIC for losses incurred on specified assets acquired from failed insured depository institutions or otherwise purchased from the FDIC that are covered by loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC.  (Exclude the assets covered by the FDIC loss-sharing agreements from this component of "All other assets." Instead, report each covered asset in the balance sheet category appropriate to the asset on Schedule RC, e.g., report covered held-for-investment loans in Schedule RC, item 4.b, "Loans and leases, net of unearned income.")

(21) Receivables from foreclosed government-guaranteed mortgage loans.

Exclude from all other assets:

(1) Redeemed U.S. savings bonds and food stamps (report in Schedule RC, item 1.a, "Noninterest-bearing balances and currency and coin," and, if applicable, in Schedule RC-A, item 1, "Cash items in process of collection, unposted debits, and currency and coin").

(3) Accounts identified as "building accounts," "construction accounts," or "remodeling accounts" (report in Schedule RC, item 6, "Premises and fixed assets").

(4) Real estate acquired in any manner for debts previously contracted (including, but not limited to, real estate acquired through foreclosure and real estate acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure), even if the bank has not yet received title to the property, and real estate collateral underlying a loan when the bank has obtained physical possession of the collateral (report as "Other real estate owned" in Schedule RC, item 7).

(5) Due bills representing purchases of securities or other assets by the reporting bank that have not yet been delivered (report as loans in Schedule RC-C).

(6) Factored accounts receivable (report as loans in Schedule RC-C).


[1] For banks involved in insurance activities, examples of prepaid expenses include ceding fees and acquisition fees paid to insurance carriers external to the consolidated bank.</label>

In general, this amount is the cash surrender value reported to the bank by the insurance carrier, less any applicable surrender charges not reflected by the carrier in the reported cash surrender value, on all forms of permanent life insurance policies owned by the bank, its consolidated subsidiaries, and grantor (rabbi) trusts established by the bank or its consolidated subsidiaries, regardless of the purposes for acquiring the insurance. A bank should also consider any additional amounts included in the contractual terms of the insurance policy in determining the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract. For further information, see the Glossary entry for "bank-owned life insurance."

Permanent life insurance refers to whole and universal life insurance, including variable universal life insurance. Purposes for which insurance may be acquired include offsetting pre- and post-retirement costs for employee compensation and benefit plans, protecting against the loss of key persons, and providing retirement and death benefits to employees.

Include as life insurance assets the bank's interest in insurance policies under split-dollar life insurance arrangements with directors, officers, and employees under both the endorsement and collateral assignment methods.</label>

In a separate account policy, the policy's cash surrender value is supported by assets segregated from the general assets of the insurance carrier. Under such an arrangement, the policyholder neither owns the underlying separate account created by the insurance carrier on its behalf nor controls investment decisions in the underlying account, but does assume all investment and price risk.

Separate accounts are employed by life insurers to meet specific investment objectives of policyholders. The accounts are often maintained as separate accounting and reporting entities for pension plans as well as fixed benefit, variable annuity, and other products. Investment income and investment gains and losses generally accrue directly to such policyholders and are not accounted for on the general accounts of the insurer. On the books of the insurer, the carrying values of separate account assets and liabilities usually approximate each other with little associated capital. Because they are legally segregated, the assets of each separate account are not subject to claims on the insurer that arise out of any other business of the insurance company.</label>

A hybrid account insurance policy combines features of both general and separate account insurance products. Similar to a general account life insurance policy, the general assets of the insurance company issuing the policy support the policy's cash surrender value. However, like a separate account policy, the assets of a hybrid account assets are protected from claims on the insurer. Additionally, the bank holding the hybrid account life insurance policy is able to select the investment strategy in which the insurance premiums are invested. Hybrid policies do not offer stable value protection, but generally offer a guaranteed minimum crediting rate.</label>

Schedule RC-K
Report the quarterly average for the bank's total assets, as defined for "Total assets," on Schedule RC, item 12, except that this quarterly average should reflect all debt securities (not held for trading) at amortized cost and available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values at the lower of cost or fair value, and equity securities without readily determinable fair values at historical cost.  In addition, to the extent that net deferred tax assets included in the bank's total assets, if any, include the deferred tax effects of any unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, these deferred tax effects may be excluded from the determination of the quarterly average for total assets.  If these deferred tax effects are excluded, this treatment must be followed consistently over time.

All transactions within the consolidated bank should be reported on a net basis. 

A spot contract is an agreement for the immediate delivery, usually within two business days, of a foreign currency at the prevailing cash market rate.  Spot contracts are considered outstanding (i.e., open) until they have been cancelled by acquisition or delivery of the underlying currencies.
			
Only one side of a spot foreign exchange contract is to be reported.  In those transactions where foreign (non-U.S.) currencies are bought or sold against U.S. dollars, report only that side of the transaction that involves the foreign (non-U.S.) currency.  For example, if the reporting bank enters into a spot contract which obligates the bank to purchase U.S. dollar exchange against which it sells Japanese yen, then the bank would report (in U.S. dollar equivalent values) the amount of Japanese yen sold in this item.   In cross-currency spot foreign exchange transactions, which involve the purchase and sale of two non-U.S. currencies, only the purchase side is to be reported (in U.S. dollar equivalent values).

Report only the aggregate amount of those types of "other off-balance sheet liabilities" that individually exceed 10 percent of the bank's total equity capital reported in Schedule RC, item 27.a.  If the bank has no types of "other off-balance sheet liabilities" that individually exceed 10 percent of total equity capital, report a zero.

Disclose in items 9.a through 9.f each type of "other off-balance sheet liabilities" reportable in this item, and the dollar amount of the off-balance sheet liability, that individually exceeds 25 percent of the bank's total equity capital reported in Schedule RC, item 27.a.

These descriptions should not exceed 50 characters in length (including spacing between words).

Include as other off-balance sheet liabilities:

(1)  Securities borrowed against collateral (other than cash), or on an uncollateralized basis, for such purposes as a pledge against deposit liabilities or delivery against short sales.  Report borrowed securities that are fully collateralized by similar securities of equivalent value at market value at the time they are borrowed.  Report other borrowed securities at market value as of the report date.  (Report the amount of securities borrowed in Schedule RC-L, item 9.a, if this amount exceeds 25 percent of the bank's total equity capital reported in Schedule RC, item 27.a.) 
 
(2)  Contracts for the purchase of when-issued securities that are excluded from the requirements of ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended) (and therefore not reported as forward contracts in Schedule RC-L, item 12.b, below), and accounted for on a settlement-date basis.  (Report the amount of these commitments in Schedule RC-L, item 9.b, if this amount exceeds 25 percent of the bank's total equity capital reported in Schedule RC, item 27.a.)

(3)  Standby letters of credit issued by another depository institution (such as a correspondent bank), a Federal Home Loan Bank, or any other entity on behalf of the reporting bank, which is the account party on the letters of credit and therefore is obligated to reimburse the issuing entity for all payments made under the standby letters of credit.  (Report the amount of these standby letters of credit in Schedule RC-L, item 9.c, if this amount exceeds 25 percent of the bank's total equity capital reported in Schedule RC, item 27.a.)

(4)  Financial guarantee insurance which insures the timely payment of principal and interest on bond issues.

(5)  Letters of indemnity other than those issued in connection with the replacement of lost or stolen or official checks.  

(6)  Shipside or dockside guarantees or similar guarantees relating to missing bills of lading or title documents and other document guarantees that facilitate the replacement of lost or stolen official checks.

It is a separate and distinct business line from credit card issuing.  Merchant processing activity involves obtaining authorization for credit card sales transactions, gathering sales information from the merchant, collecting funds from the card-issuing bank or business, and crediting the merchants' accounts for their sales. 

An acquiring bank is a bank that initiates and maintains contractual agreements with merchants, agent banks, and third parties (e.g., independent sales organizations and member service providers) for the purpose of accepting and processing credit card transactions.  An acquiring bank has liability for chargebacks for the merchants' sales activity.

An agent bank with risk is a bank that, by agreement, participates in another bank's merchant credit card acceptance program.  An agent bank with risk assumes liability for chargebacks for all or a portion of the loss for the merchants' sales activity. 

For purposes of items 11.a and 11.b, banks should include credit card sales transactions involving bank credit cards, e.g., MasterCard and Visa. 

For banks with total assets of $10 billion or more, the year-to-date sales volume may be reported to the nearest million, with zeros reported in the thousands column, rather than to the nearest thousand.

Include both freestanding derivative contracts and embedded derivatives that must be accounted for separately from their host contract under Statement No. 133.  Report each contract according to its underlying risk exposure:  (a) interest rate, (b) foreign exchange, (c) equity, or (d) commodity and other.

However, exclude from Schedule RC-L, items 12 through 15, all credit derivatives, which should be reported in Schedule RC-L, item 7, above.
 
The notional amount or par value to be reported for a derivative contract with a multiplier component is the contract's effective notional amount or par value.  For example, a swap contract with a stated notional amount of $1,000,000 whose terms called for quarterly settlement of the difference between 5% and LIBOR multiplied by 10 has an effective notional amount of $10,000,000.

All transactions within the consolidated bank should be reported on a net basis.  No other netting of contracts is permitted for purposes of this item.  Therefore, do not net:  (1) obligations of the reporting bank to purchase from third parties against the bank's obligations to sell to third parties, (2) written options against purchased options, or (3) contracts subject to bilateral netting agreements.  

For each column, the sum of items 12.a through 12.e must equal the sum of items 13 and 14.

Column Instructions

Column A, Interest Rate Contracts:  Interest rate contracts are contracts related to an interest-bearing financial instrument or whose cash flows are determined by referencing interest rates or another interest rate contract (e.g., an option on a futures contract to purchase a Treasury bill).  These contracts are generally used to adjust the bank's interest rate exposure or, if the bank is an intermediary, the interest rate exposure of others.  Interest rate contracts include interest rate futures, single currency interest rate swaps, basis swaps, forward rate agreements, and interest rate options, including caps, floors, collars, and corridors.

Exclude contracts involving the exchange of one or more foreign currencies (e.g., cross currency swaps and currency options) and other contracts whose predominant risk characteristic is foreign exchange risk, which are to be reported in column B as foreign exchange contracts.

Unsettled securities transactions that exceed the regular way settlement time limit that is customary in each relevant market must be reported as forward contracts in Schedule RC L, item 12.b.

Column B, Foreign Exchange Contracts:  Foreign exchange contracts are contracts to purchase foreign (non-U.S.) currencies and U.S. dollar exchange in the forward market, i.e., on an organized exchange or in an over-the-counter market.  A purchase of U.S. dollar exchange is equivalent to a sale of foreign currency.  Foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps where there is an exchange of principal, forward foreign exchange contracts (usually settling three or more business days from trade date), and currency futures and currency options.  Exclude spot foreign exchange contracts, which are to be reported in Schedule RC-L, item 8.

Only one side of a foreign currency transaction is to be reported.  In those transactions where foreign (non-U.S.) currencies are bought or sold against U.S. dollars, report only that side of the transaction that involves the foreign (non-U.S.) currency.  For example, if the reporting bank enters into a futures contract which obligates the bank to purchase U.S. dollar exchange against which it sells Japanese yen, then the bank would report (in U.S. dollar equivalent values) the amount of Japanese yen sold in Schedule RC-L, item 12.a.  In cross currency transactions, which involve the purchase and sale of two non U.S. currencies, only the purchase side is to be reported.

All amounts in column B are to be reported in U.S. dollar equivalent values.
 
Column C, Equity Derivative Contracts:  Equity derivative contracts are contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of a particular equity or to an index of equity prices, such as the Standard and Poor's 500.

The contract amount to be reported for equity derivative contracts is the quantity, e.g., number of units, of the equity instrument or equity index contracted for purchase or sale multiplied by the contract price of a unit.

Column D, Commodity and Other Contracts:  Commodity contracts are contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of or to an index of precious metals, petroleum, lumber, agricultural products, etc.  Commodity and other contracts also include any other contracts that are not reportable as interest rate, foreign exchange, or equity derivative contracts.

The contract amount to be reported for commodity and other contracts is the quantity, e.g., number of units, of the commodity or product contracted for purchase or sale multiplied by the contract price of a unit.

The notional amount to be reported for commodity contracts with multiple exchanges of principal is the contractual amount multiplied by the number of remaining payments (i.e., exchanges of principal) in the contract.

Report, in the appropriate column, the aggregate par value of futures contracts that have been entered into by the reporting bank and are outstanding (i.e., open contracts) as of the report date.  Do not report the par value of financial instruments intended to be delivered under such contracts if this par value differs from the par value of the contracts themselves.

Contracts are outstanding (i.e., open) until they have been cancelled by acquisition or delivery of the underlying financial instruments or by offset.  Offset is the liquidating of a purchase of futures through the sale of an equal number of contracts of the same delivery month on the same underlying instrument on the same exchange, or the covering of a short sale of futures through the purchase of an equal number of contracts of the same delivery month on the same underlying instrument on the same exchange.

Column A, Interest Rate Futures:  Report futures contracts committing the reporting bank to purchase or sell financial instruments and whose predominant risk characteristic is interest rate risk.  Some of the more common interest rate futures include futures on 90-day U.S. Treasury bills; 12-year GNMA pass-through securities; and 2-, 4-, 6-, and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes.

Column B, Foreign Exchange Futures:  Report the gross amount (stated in U.S. dollars) of all futures contracts committing the reporting bank to purchase foreign (non-U.S.) currencies and U.S. dollar exchange and whose predominant risk characteristic is foreign exchange risk.

 
A currency futures contract is a standardized agreement for delayed delivery of a foreign (non-U.S.) currency or U.S. dollar exchange in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver, at a specified future date, a specified amount at a specified exchange rate.

Column C, Equity Derivative Futures:  Report futures contracts committing the reporting bank to purchase or sell equity securities or instruments based on equity indexes such as the Standard and Poor's 500 or the Nikkei.

Column D, Commodity and Other Futures:  Report the contract amount for all futures contracts committing the reporting bank to purchase or sell commodities such as agricultural products (e.g., wheat, coffee), precious metals (e.g., gold, platinum), and non-ferrous metals (e.g., copper, zinc).  Include any other futures contract that is not reportable as an interest rate, foreign exchange, or equity derivative contract in column A, B, or C.

Forward starting swap contracts should be reported as swaps.  The notional amount of a swap is the underlying principal amount upon which the exchange of interest, foreign exchange or other income or expense is based.  The notional amount to be reported for a swap contract with a multiplier component is the contract's effective notional amount.  In those cases where the reporting bank is acting as an intermediary, both sides of the transaction are to be reported.

Column A, Interest Rate Swaps:  Report the notional amount of all outstanding interest rate and basis swaps whose predominant risk characteristic is interest rate risk.  

Column B, Foreign Exchange Swaps:  Report the notional principal amount (stated in U.S. dollars) of all outstanding cross-currency interest rate swaps.  A cross-currency interest rate swap is a transaction in which two parties agree to exchange principal amounts of different currencies, usually at the prevailing spot rate, at the inception of an agreement that lasts for a certain number of years.  At defined intervals over the life of the swap, the counterparties exchange payments in the different currencies based on specified rates of interest.  When the agreement matures, the principal amounts will be re exchanged at the same spot rate.  The notional amount of a cross-currency interest rate swap is generally the underlying principal amount upon which the exchange is based.
 
Column C, Equity Swaps:  Report the notional amount of all outstanding equity or equity index swaps.

Column D, Commodity and Other Swaps:  Report the notional principal amount of all other swap agreements that are not reportable as either interest rate, foreign exchange, or equity derivative contracts in column A, B, or C.  The notional amount to be reported for commodity contracts with multiple exchanges of principal is the contractual amount multiplied by the number of remaining payments (or exchanges of principal) in the contract.

Guidance for reporting by type of underlying risk exposure is provided in the instructions for Schedule RC L, item 12, above.  Guidance for reporting by purpose is provided in the instructions for Schedule RC-L, items 13 and 14, above.

All transactions within the consolidated bank should be reported on a net basis.  No other netting of contracts is permitted for purposes of this item.  Therefore, do not net (1) obligations of the reporting bank to buy against the bank's obligations to sell, (2) written options against purchased options, (3) positive fair values against negative fair values, or (4) contracts subject to bilateral netting agreements.

As defined in FASB Statement No. 133, fair value is the amount at which an asset (liability) could be bought (incurred) or sold (settled) in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.  Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and should be used as the basis for the measurement, if available.  If a quoted market price is available, the fair value is the product of the number of trading units times that market price.  If a quoted market price is not available, the estimate of fair value should be based on the best information available in the circumstances.  The estimate of fair value should consider prices for similar assets or similar liabilities and the results of valuation techniques to the extent available in the circumstances.  For purposes of item 15, the reporting bank should determine the fair value of its derivative contracts in the same manner that it determines the fair value of these contracts for other financial reporting purposes.

Unused commitments are to be reported gross, i.e., include in the appropriate subitem the unused amount of commitments acquired from and conveyed or participated to others.  However, exclude commitments conveyed or participated to others that the bank is not legally obligated to fund even if the party to whom the commitment has been conveyed or participated fails to perform in accordance with the terms of the commitment.

For purposes of this item, commitments include:

(1) Commitments to make or purchase extensions of credit in the form of loans or participations in loans, lease financing receivables, or similar transactions.

(2) Commitments for which the bank has charged a commitment fee or other consideration.

(3) Commitments that are legally binding.

(4) Loan proceeds that the bank is obligated to advance, such as:

	(a) Loan draws;
	(b) Construction progress payments; and
	(c) Seasonal or living advances to farmers under prearranged lines of credit.

(5) Rotating, revolving, and open-end credit arrangements, including, but not limited to, retail credit card lines and home equity lines of credit.

(6) Commitments to issue a commitment at some point in the future, where the bank has extended terms, the borrower has accepted the offered terms, and the extension and acceptance of the terms are in writing or, if not in writing, are legally binding on the bank and the borrower, even though the related loan agreement has not yet been signed.

(7) Overdraft protection on depositors' accounts offered under a program where the bank advises account holders of the available amount of overdraft protection, for example, when accounts are opened or on depositors' account statements or ATM receipts.

(8) The bank's own takedown in securities underwriting transactions.

(9) Revolving underwriting facilities (RUFs), note issuance facilities (NIFs), and other similar arrangements, which are facilities under which a borrower can issue on a revolving basis short term paper in its own name, but for which the underwriting banks have a legally binding commitment either to purchase any notes the borrower is unable to sell by the rollover date or to advance funds to the borrower. 

Exclude forward contracts and other commitments that meet the definition of a derivative and must be accounted for in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly referred to as FASB Statement No. 133), which should be reported in Schedule RC-L, item 12.  Include the amount (not the fair value) of the unused portions of loan commitments that do not meet the definition of a derivative that the bank has elected to report at fair value under a fair value option.  Also include forward contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative.

The unused portions of commitments are to be reported in the appropriate subitem regardless of whether they contain "material adverse change" clauses or other provisions that are intended to relieve the issuer of its funding obligations under certain conditions and regardless of whether they are unconditionally cancelable at any time.

In the case of commitments for syndicated loans, report only the bank's proportional share of the commitment.

For purposes of reporting the unused portions of revolving asset-based lending commitments, the commitment is defined as the amount a bank is obligated to fund - as of the report date - based on the contractually agreed upon terms.  In the case of revolving asset-based lending, the unused portions of such commitments should be measured as the difference between (a) the lesser of the contractual borrowing base (i.e., eligible collateral times the advance rate) or the note commitment limit, and (b) the sum of outstanding loans and letters of credit under the commitment.  The note commitment limit is the overall maximum loan amount beyond which the bank will not advance funds regardless of the amount of collateral posted.  This definition of "commitment" is applicable only to revolving asset-based lending, which is a specialized form of secured lending in which a borrower uses current assets (e.g., accounts receivable and inventory) as collateral for a loan.  The loan is structured so that the amount of credit is limited by the value of the collateral.</label>

Banks should report the notional amounts of credit derivatives by remaining maturity in Schedule RC-L, items 7.d.(1)(a) through 7.d.(2)(b).

All credit derivative transactions within the consolidated bank should be reported on a net basis, i.e., intrabank transactions should not be reported in this item. No other netting of contracts is permitted for purposes of this item. Therefore, do not net the notional amounts or fair values of: (1) credit derivatives with third parties on which the reporting bank is the protection purchaser against credit derivatives with third parties on which the reporting bank is the protection seller, or (2) contracts subject to bilateral netting agreements. The notional amounts of credit derivatives should not be included in Schedule RC-L, items 12 through 14, and the fair values of credit derivatives should not be included in Schedule RC-L, item 15.</label>

A credit default swap is a contract in which a protection seller or guarantor (risk taker), for a fee, agrees to reimburse a protection purchaser or beneficiary (risk hedger) for any losses that occur due to a credit event on a particular entity, called the "reference entity." If there is no credit default event (as defined by the derivative contract), then the protection seller makes no payments to the protection purchaser and receives only the contractually specified fee. Under standard industry definitions, a credit event is normally defined to include bankruptcy, failure to pay, and restructuring. Other potential credit events include obligation acceleration, obligation default, and repudiation/moratorium.</label>

A total return swap transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset, which includes all associated cash flows, as well as capital appreciation or depreciation. The protection purchaser (beneficiary) receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller. The protection seller (guarantor) has the opposite profile. The protection seller receives cash flows on the reference asset, plus any appreciation, and it pays any depreciation to the protection purchaser, plus a floating interest rate. A total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset.</label>

As defined in FASB Statement No. 157, fair value for an asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants (not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) in the asset's or liability's principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date. For further information, see the Glossary entry for "fair value." For purposes of this item, the reporting bank should determine the fair value of its credit derivative contracts in the same manner that it determines the fair value of these contracts for other financial reporting purposes.</label>

Column Instructions for items 16.a and 16.b.(1) through (8):

Column A, Banks and Securities Firms: Banks include U.S. banks and foreign banks as defined in the Glossary entry for "Banks, U.S. and Foreign." Securities firms include broker-dealers that are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), firms engaged in securities activities in the European Union (EU) that are subject to the EU's Capital Adequacy Directive, and other firms engaged in securities activities.

Column B, Monoline Financial Guarantors: Monoline financial guarantors are companies that are primarily engaged in the business of providing credit enhancement in the form of a "guarantee" of payment of principal and interest to bond issuers when an issuer defaults. In essence, these companies provide a back-up guarantee, which generally increases the bond rating of debt issued by lower-rated borrowers, in exchange for insurance premiums. Monoline financial guarantors provide guarantees on securities that range from municipal bonds to structured financial products such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).

Column C, Hedge Funds: Hedge funds are generally privately-owned investment funds with a limited range of investors. Hedge funds are not required to register with the SEC, which provides them with an exemption in many jurisdictions from regulations governing short selling, derivative contracts, leverage, fee structures, and the liquidity of investments in the fund.

Column D, Sovereign Governments: Sovereign governments are the central governments of foreign countries.

The current credit exposure (sometimes referred to as the replacement cost) is the fair value of a derivative contract when that fair value is positive. The current credit exposure is zero when the fair value is negative or zero. For purposes of this item, the net current credit exposure to an individual counterparty should be derived as follows: Determine whether a legally enforceable bilateral netting agreement is in place between the reporting bank and the counterparty. If such an agreement is in place, the fair values of all applicable derivative contracts with that counterparty that are included in the scope of the netting agreement are netted to a single amount, which may be positive, negative, or zero.</label>

For purposes of this item, the terms "extension of credit," "executive officer," "director," "principal shareholder," and "related interest," are as defined in Federal Reserve Board Regulation O. 

An "extension of credit" is a making or renewal of any loan, a granting of a line of credit, or an extending of credit in any manner whatsoever. Extensions of credit include, among others, loans, overdrafts, cash items, standby letters of credit, and securities purchased under agreements to resell. For lines of credit, the amount to be reported as an extension of credit is normally the total amount of the line of credit extended to the insider, not just the current balance of the funds that have been advanced to the insider under the line of credit. See Section 215.3 of Regulation O for further details.

An "executive officer" of the reporting bank generally means a person who participates or has authority to participate (other than in the capacity of a director) in major policymaking functions of the reporting bank, an executive officer of a bank holding company of which the bank is a subsidiary, and (unless properly excluded by the bank's board of directors or bylaws) an executive officer of any other subsidiary of that bank holding company. See Section 215.2(e) of Regulation O for further details.
			
A "director" of the reporting bank generally means a person who is a director of a bank, whether or not receiving compensation, a director of a bank holding company of which the bank is a subsidiary, and (unless properly excluded by the bank's board of directors or bylaws) a director of any other subsidiary of that bank holding company. See Section 215.2(d) of Regulation O for further details.
			
A "principal shareholder" of the reporting bank generally means an individual or a company (other than an insured bank or foreign bank) that directly or indirectly owns, controls, or has the power to vote more than ten percent of any class of voting securities of the reporting bank. See Section 215.11(a)(1) of Regulation O for further details.
			
A "related interest" means (1) a company (other than an insured bank or a foreign bank) that is controlled by an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder or (2) a political or campaign committee that is controlled by or the funds or services of which will benefit an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder. See Section 215.11(a)(2) of Regulation O.</label>

			An intangible asset with a finite life (other than a servicing asset) should be amortized over its estimated useful life and should be reviewed at least quarterly to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.  If this review indicates that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, the intangible asset should be tested for recoverability (impairment) in accordance with FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  An impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and this amount exceeds the asset's fair value.  The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from the intangible asset.  An impairment loss is recognized by writing the intangible asset down to its fair value (which becomes the new accounting basis of the intangible asset), with a corresponding charge to expense (which should be reported in Schedule RI, item 7.c.(2)).

According to FASB Statement No. 140, the fair value of mortgage servicing assets is the amount at which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.  Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and should be used to measure fair value if available.  If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value should be based on the best information available in the circumstances, considering prices for similar assets and the results of valuation techniques such as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved.  Valuation techniques for measuring servicing assets should be consistent with the objective of measuring fair value and should incorporate assumptions that market participants would use. Estimates of expected future cash flows, if used to estimate fair value, should be the best estimate based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections.

For purposes of this item, the reporting bank should determine the fair value of mortgage servicing assets in the same manner that it determines the fair value of these assets for other financial reporting purposes, consistent with the guidance in FASB Statement No. 140.

Purchased credit card relationships represent the right to conduct ongoing credit card business dealings with the cardholders.  In general, purchased credit card relationships are an amount paid in excess of the value of the purchased credit card receivables.  Such relationships arise when the reporting bank purchases existing credit card receivables and also has the right to provide credit card services to those customers.  Purchased credit card relationships may also be acquired when the reporting bank purchases an entire depository institution.

Purchased credit card relationships shall be carried at amortized cost.  Management of the institution shall review the carrying amount at least quarterly, adequately document this review, and adjust the carrying amount as necessary.  This review should determine whether unanticipated acceleration or deceleration of cardholder payments, account attrition, changes in fees or finance charges, or other events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the purchased credit card relationships may not be recoverable.  If this review indicates that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, the intangible asset should be tested for recoverability, and any impairment loss should be recognized, as described in the instruction for Schedule RC-M, item 2.

Nonmortgage servicing assets are contracts to service financial assets, other than loans secured by real estate (as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1) under which the estimated future revenues from contractually specified servicing fees, late charges, and other ancillary revenues are expected to more than adequately compensate the servicer for performing the servicing.

Include as all other real estate owned:

(1) Foreclosed real estate, i.e.,

	(a) Real estate acquired in any manner for debts previously contracted (including, but not limited to, real estate acquired through foreclosure and real estate acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure), even if the bank has not yet received title to the property.

	(b) Real estate collateral underlying a loan when the bank has obtained physical possession of the collateral, regardless of whether formal foreclosure proceedings have been instituted against the borrower.

Foreclosed real estate received in full or partial satisfaction of a loan should be recorded at the fair value less cost to sell of the property at the time of foreclosure. This amount becomes the "cost" of the foreclosed real estate. When foreclosed real estate is received in full satisfaction of a loan, the amount, if any, by which the recorded amount of the loan exceeds the fair value less cost to sell of the property is a loss which must be charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses at the time of foreclosure. The amount of any senior debt (principal and accrued interest) to which foreclosed real estate is subject at the time of foreclosure must be reported as a liability in Schedule RC, item 16, "Other borrowed money."

After foreclosure, each foreclosed real estate asset must be carried at the lower of (1) the fair value of the asset minus the estimated costs to sell the asset or (2) the cost of the asset (as defined in the preceding paragraph). This determination must be made on an asset-by-asset basis. If the fair value of a foreclosed real estate asset minus the estimated costs to sell the asset is less than the asset's cost, the deficiency must be recognized as a valuation allowance against the asset which is created through a charge to expense. The valuation allowance should thereafter be increased or decreased (but not below zero) through charges or credits to expense for changes in the asset's fair value or estimated selling costs. (For further information, see the Glossary entries for "foreclosed assets" and "troubled debt restructurings.")

(2) Foreclosed real estate backing mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or guaranteed by the Veterans Administration (VA) that back Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) securities, i.e., "GNMA loans."

(3) Property originally acquired for future expansion but no longer intended to be used for that purpose.

(4) Foreclosed real estate sold under contract and accounted for under the deposit method of accounting in accordance with FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. Under this method, the seller does not record notes receivable, but continues to report the real estate and any related existing debt on its balance sheet. The deposit method is used when a sale has not been consummated and is commonly used when recovery of the carrying value of the property is not reasonably assured. If the full accrual, installment, cost recovery, reduced profit, or percentage-of-completion method of accounting under FASB Statement No. 66 is being used to account for the sale, the receivable resulting from the sale of the foreclosed real estate should be reported as a loan in Schedule RC-C and any gain on the sale should be recognized in accordance with FASB Statement No. 66. For further information, see the Glossary entry for "foreclosed assets."

Property formerly but no longer used for banking may be reported either in this item as "All other real estate owned" or in Schedule RC, item 6, as "Premises and fixed assets."

A fixed interest rate is a rate that is specified at the origination of the advance or other borrowing, is fixed and invariable during the term of the advance or other borrowing, and is known to both the bank and the creditor.  Also treated as a fixed interest rate is a predetermined interest rate, which is a rate that changes on a predetermined basis during the term of the advance or other borrowing, with the exact rate of interest over the life of the advance or other borrowing known with certainty to both the bank and the creditor when the advance or other borrowing is originated.

A floating rate is a rate that varies, or can vary, in relation to an index, to some other interest rate such as the rate on certain U.S. Government securities, or to some other variable criterion the exact value of which cannot be known in advance.  Therefore, the exact interest rate the advance or other borrowing carries at any subsequent time cannot be known at the time the advance or other borrowing is originated by the bank or subsequently renewed. 

When the rate on an advance or other borrowing with a floating rate has reached a contractual floor or ceiling level, the advance or other borrowing is to be treated as "fixed rate" rather than as "floating rate" until the rate is again free to float.

Remaining maturity is amount of time remaining from the report date until the final contractual maturity of an advance or an other borrowing without regard to the advance's or the borrowing's repayment schedule, if any.  

Next repricing date is (a) the date the interest rate on an advance or other borrowing with a floating rate can next change in accordance with the terms of the contract or (b) the contractual maturity date of the advance or other borrowing, whichever is earlier.

Advances and other borrowings with a fixed rate that are callable at the option of the Federal Home Loan Bank or other creditor should be reported according to their remaining maturity without regard to their next call date unless the advance or other borrowing has actually been called.  When an advance or other borrowing with a fixed rate has been called, it should be reported based on the time remaining until the call date.  Advances and other borrowings with a floating rate that are callable should be reported on the basis of their next repricing date without regard to their next call date unless the advance or other borrowing has actually been called.  Advances and other borrowings with a floating rate that have been called should be reported on the basis of their next repricing date or their actual call date, whichever is earlier.

Advances and other borrowings with a fixed rate that are puttable at the option of the bank should be reported according to their remaining maturity without regard to put dates if the bank has not exercised the put.  If a put on an advance or other borrowing with a fixed rate has been exercised but the advance or other borrowing has not yet been repaid, the advance or other borrowing should be reported based on the amount of time remaining until the actual put date.  Advances and other borrowings with a floating rate that are puttable should be reported on the basis of their next repricing date without regard to their next put date unless the put has actually been exercised.  If a put on an advance or other borrowing with a floating rate has been exercised but the advance or other borrowing has not yet been repaid, the advance or other borrowing should be reported on the basis of its next repricing date or its actual put date, whichever is earlier.

Convertible advances should be reported based on the amount of time until the Federal Home Loan Bank can next opt to convert the rate on the borrowing to a floating rate or the contractual maturity date, whichever is earlier.

Other borrowings that are noninterest-bearing should be treated as fixed rate and reported according to the amount of time remaining until the final contractual maturity.

Place an "X" in the box marked "YES" if the bank, a bank subsidiary or other bank affiliate, or an unaffiliated entity sells private label or third party mutual funds and annuities:

(1)	on bank premises; 

(2)	from which the bank receives income at the time of the sale or over the duration of the account (e.g., annual fees, Rule 12b-1 fees or "trailer fees," and redemption fees); or

Otherwise, place an "X" in the box marked "NO".

Mutual fund is the common name for an open-end investment company whose shares are sold to the investing public.  An annuity is an investment product, typically underwritten by an insurance company, that pays either a fixed or variable payment stream over a specified period of time.  Both proprietary and private label mutual funds and annuities are established in order to be marketed primarily to a bank's or banking organization's customers.  A proprietary product is a product for which the reporting bank or a subsidiary or other affiliate of the reporting bank acts as investment adviser and may perform additional support services.  In a private label product, an unaffiliated entity acts as the investment adviser.  The identity of the investment adviser is normally disclosed in the prospectus for a mutual fund or annuity.  Mutual funds and annuities that are not proprietary or private label products are considered third party products.  For example, third party mutual funds and annuities include products that are widely marketed by numerous parties to the investing public and have investment advisers that are not affiliated with the reporting bank.</label>

A general description of a proprietary product is included in the instruction to Schedule RC-M, item 6, above.  Proprietary mutual funds and annuities are typically created by large banking organizations and offered to customers of the banking organization's subsidiary banks.  Therefore, small, independent banks do not normally act as investment advisers for mutual funds and annuities.  
			
If neither the bank nor any subsidiary of the bank acts as investment adviser for a mutual fund or annuity, the bank should report a zero or the word "none" in this item.

Any losses above the stated threshold amount are reimbursed by the FDIC at 95 percent of the losses recognized by the acquirer. For more recent transactions, the FDIC generally reimburses 80 percent of the losses incurred by the acquirer on covered assets, with the acquiring institution absorbing 20 percent.

In general, the maximum amount recoverable from the FDIC on covered other real estate owned is the carrying amount of the other real estate, as reported in the preceding Schedule RC-M items, multiplied by the currently applicable loss coverage rate (e.g., 80 percent or 95 percent). This product will normally be the maximum amount recoverable because reimbursements from the FDIC for covered losses related to the amount by which the "book value" of a covered asset on the failed institution's books (which is the amount upon which payments under an FDIC loss-sharing agreement are based) exceeds the amount at which the reporting bank reports the covered asset on Schedule RC, Balance Sheet, should already have been taken into account in measuring the carrying amount of the reporting bank's loss-sharing indemnification asset, which is reported in Schedule RC-F, item 6, "All other assets."</label>

The QTL test has been in place since it was enacted as part of the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987. To be a QTL, a savings association (or a state savings or cooperative bank that has elected to be treated as a QTL) must either meet the HOLA QTL test (12 U.S.C. 1467a(m)) or the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Domestic Building and Loan Association (DBLA) test (26 CFR 301.7701-13A). Under the HOLA QTL test, an institution must hold "Qualified Thrift Investments" equal to at least 65 percent of its portfolio assets. To be a QTL under the IRS DBLA test, an institution must meet a "business operations test" and a "60 percent of assets test." An institution may use either test to qualify and may switch from one test to the other. However, the institution must meet the time requirements of the respective test, which is nine out of the last 12 months for the HOLA QTL test or the taxable year (which may be either a calendar or fiscal year) for the IRS DBLA test. A savings association (or a state savings or cooperative bank that has elected to be treated as a QTL) that fails to meet the QTL requirements is subject to certain restrictions, including limits on activities, branching, and dividends.</label>

(1) Are "remittance transfers" as defined by Subpart B of Regulation E (12 CFR 1005.30(e)), or
(2) Would qualify as "remittance transfers" under Subpart B of Regulation E (12 CFR 1005.30(e)) but are excluded from that definition only because the provider is not providing those transfers in the normal course of its business. See 12 CFR 1005.30(f).

Subpart B of Regulation E took effect on October 28, 2013. For purposes of responding to the questions in Schedule RC-M, items 16.a and 16.b, below, as they apply to periods in 2012 and 2013 prior to that date, institutions should apply the definitions and terms in Subpart B of Regulation E as if they had nevertheless been in effect.

Under Subpart B of Regulation E, a "remittance transfer" is an electronic transfer of funds requested by a sender to a designated recipient that is sent by a remittance transfer provider. The term applies regardless of whether the sender holds an account with the remittance transfer provider, and regardless of whether the transaction is also an "electronic fund transfer," as defined in Regulation E. See 12 CFR 1005.30(e).

A "remittance transfer provider" is any person that provides remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business, regardless of whether the consumer holds an account with such person. See 12 CFR 1005.30(f).

Examples of remittance transfers include the following (see Regulation E, Subpart B, comment 30(e)-3.i):

(1) Transfers where the sender provides cash or another method of payment to a money transmitter or financial institution and requests that funds be sent to a specified location or account in a foreign country.
(2) Consumer wire transfers, where a financial institution executes a payment order upon a sender's request to wire money from the sender's account to a designated recipient.
(3) An addition of funds to a prepaid card by a participant in a prepaid card program, such as a prepaid card issuer or its agent, that is directly engaged with the sender to add these funds, where the prepaid card is sent or was previously sent by a participant in the prepaid card program to a person in a foreign country, even if a person located in a State (including a sender) retains the ability to withdraw such funds.
(4) International automated clearing house (ACH) transactions sent by the sender's financial institution at the sender's request.
(5) Online bill payments and other electronic transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers, made by the sender's financial institution at the sender's request to a designated recipient.

Under Subpart B of Regulation E, the term "remittance transfer" does not include, for example:

(1) Small value transactions, i.e., transfer amounts, as described in 12 CFR 1005.31(b)(1)(i), of $15 or less. See 12 CFR 1005.30(e)(2)(i).
(2) Securities and commodities transfers that are excluded from the definition of electronic fund transfer under 12 CFR 1005.3(c)(4). See 12 CFR 1005.30(e)(2)(ii).
(3) A consumer's provision of a debit, credit or prepaid card, directly to a foreign merchant as payment for goods or services because the issuer is not directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds to the foreign merchant when the issuer provides payment to the merchant. See Regulation E, Subpart B, comment 30(e)-3.ii.A.
(4) A consumer's deposit of funds to a checking or savings account located in a State, because there has not been a transfer of funds to a designated recipient. See Regulation E, Subpart B, comment 30(e)-3.ii.B.
(5) Online bill payments and other electronic transfers that senders can schedule in advance, including preauthorized transfers, made through the Web site of a merchant located in a foreign country and via direct provision of a checking account, credit card, debit card or prepaid card number to the merchant, because the financial institution is not directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds to the foreign merchant when the institution provides payment to the merchant. See Regulation E, Subpart B, comment 30(e)-3.ii.C.

In general, the maximum amount recoverable from the FDIC on covered past due and nonaccrual loans and leases is the recorded amount of these loans and leases, as reported in Schedule RC-N, items 11.a.(1)(a) through 11.e, multiplied by the currently applicable loss coverage rate (e.g., 80 percent or 95 percent). This product will normally be the maximum amount recoverable because reimbursements from the FDIC for covered losses related to the amount by which the "book value" of a covered asset on the failed institution's books (which is the amount upon which payments under an FDIC loss-sharing agreement are based) exceeds the amount at which the reporting bank reports the covered asset on Schedule RC, Balance Sheet, should already have been taken into account in measuring the carrying amount of the reporting bank's loss-sharing indemnification asset, which is reported in Schedule RC-F, item 6, "All other assets."</label>

These Memorandum items should be reported on an unconsolidated single FDIC certificate number basis.

The sum of Memorandum items 1.a.(1), 1.b.(1), 1.c.(1), and 1.d.(1) must equal Schedule RC-O, item 1, "Total deposit liabilities before exclusions (gross) as defined in Section 3(l) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and FDIC regulations," less item 2, "Total allowable exclusions, including interest accrued and unpaid on allowable exclusions (including foreign deposits)." Accordingly, all amounts included in the bank's total deposit liabilities less allowable exclusions, not just those included in its "Deposits in domestic offices" (reported in Schedule RC, item 13.a), should be reported in the appropriate subitem of Memorandum item 1.  For example, the interest accrued and unpaid on a deposit account (that is not an allowable exclusion) should be reported together with the deposit account in Memorandum item 1.a.(1), 1.b.(1), 1.c.(1), or 1.d.(1), as appropriate.

The dollar amounts used as the basis for reporting the number and amount of deposit accounts in Memorandum items 1.a.(1) through 1.d.(2) reflect the deposit insurance limits of $250,000 for "retirement deposit accounts" and $250,000 for other deposit accounts.

"Retirement deposit accounts" that are eligible for $250,000 in deposit insurance coverage are deposits made in connection with the following types of retirement plans:

* Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), including traditional and Roth IRAs;

* Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans;

* "Section 457" deferred compensation plans;

* Self-directed Keogh (HR 10) plans; and

* Self-directed defined contribution plans, which are primarily 401(k) plan accounts.

The term "self-directed" means that the plan participants have the right to direct how their funds are invested, including the ability to direct that the funds be deposited at an FDIC-insured institution.

Retirement deposit accounts exclude Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, formerly known as Education IRAs.

In some cases, brokered certificates of deposit are issued in $1,000 amounts under a master certificate of deposit issued by a bank to a deposit broker in an amount that exceeds $250,000. For these so-called "retail brokered deposits," multiple purchases by individual depositors from an individual bank normally do not exceed the applicable deposit insurance limit ($250,000), but under current deposit insurance rules the deposit broker is not required to provide information routinely on these purchasers and their account ownership capacity to the bank issuing the deposits. If this information is not readily available to the issuing bank, these brokered certificates of deposit in $1,000 amounts may be rebuttably presumed to be fully insured and should be reported as "Deposit accounts of $250,000 or less" in Schedule RC-O, Memorandum item 1.a, below. In addition, when determining the number of deposit accounts of $250,000 or less to be reported in Schedule RC-O, Memorandum item 1.a.(2), the issuing institution should count each such master certificate of deposit as one account, not as multiple accounts.


Some brokered deposits are transaction accounts or money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) that are denominated in amounts of $0.01 and established and maintained by the deposit broker (or its agent) as agent, custodian, or other fiduciary for the broker's customers. An individual depositor's deposits within the brokered transaction account or MMDA normally do not exceed the applicable deposit insurance limit. As with retail brokered deposits, if information on these depositors and their account ownership capacity is not readily available to the bank establishing the transaction account or MMDA, the amounts in the transaction account or MMDA may be rebuttably presumed to be fully insured and should be reported as "Deposit accounts of $250,000 or less" in Schedule RC-O, Memorandum item 1.a, below. In addition, when determining the number of deposit accounts of $250,000 or less to be reported in Schedule RC-O, Memorandum item 1.a.(2), the issuing institution should count each such brokered transaction account or MMDA as one account, not as multiple accounts.

Time deposits issued to deposit brokers in the form of large ($250,000 or more) certificates of deposit that have been participated out by the broker in shares of less than $250,000 should also be reported as "Deposit accounts of $250,000 or less" in Schedule RC-O, Memorandum item 1.a, below. In addition, when determining the number of deposit accounts of $250,000 or less to be reported in Schedule RC-O, Memorandum item 1.a.(2), the issuing institution should count each such brokered certificate of deposit as one account, not as multiple accounts.

When determining the number and size of deposit accounts, each individual certificate, passbook, account, and other evidence of deposit is to be treated as a separate account. For purposes of completing this Memorandum item, multiple accounts of the same depositor should not be aggregated. In situations where a bank assigns a single account number to each depositor so that one account number may represent multiple deposit contracts between the bank and the depositor (e.g., one demand deposit account, one money market deposit account, and three certificates of deposit), each deposit contract is a separate account.</label>

Report on an unconsolidated single FDIC certificate number basis the estimated amount of the bank's deposits (in domestic offices and in insured branches in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions) that is not covered by federal deposit insurance.  This estimate should reflect the deposit insurance limits of $250,000 for "retirement deposit accounts" (as defined in Schedule RC-O, Memorandum item 1) and $250,000 for other deposit accounts.  The reporting of this uninsured deposit information is mandated by Section 7(a)(9) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

The estimated amount of uninsured deposits reported in this item should be based on the bank's deposits included in Schedule RC-O, item 1, "Total deposit liabilities before exclusions (gross) as defined in Section 3(l) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and FDIC regulations," less item 2, "Total allowable exclusions, including interest accrued and unpaid on allowable exclusions (including foreign deposits)."  In addition to the uninsured portion of deposits in "domestic offices" reported in Schedule RC, item 13.a, the estimate of uninsured deposits should take into account all other items included in Schedule RC-O, item 1 less item 2, including, but not limited to:

* Interest accrued and unpaid on deposits in domestic offices;
* Deposits in insured branches in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions (including interest accrued and unpaid on these deposits); 
* Deposits of consolidated subsidiaries in domestic offices and in insured branches in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions (including interest accrued and unpaid on these deposits); and
* Deposit liabilities that have been reduced by assets netted against these liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The bank's estimate of its uninsured deposits should be reported in accordance with the following criteria.  In this regard, it is recognized that a bank may have multiple automated information systems for different types of deposits and that the capabilities of a bank's information systems to provide an estimate of its uninsured deposits will differ from bank to bank at any point in time and, within an individual institution, may improve over time. 

(1)  If the bank has brokered deposits, which must be reported in Schedule RC-E, Memorandum item 1.b, "Total brokered deposits," it must use the information it has developed for completing Schedule RC-E, Memorandum item 1.c, "Fully insured brokered deposits," to determine its best estimate of the uninsured portion of its brokered deposits.

 (2)  If the bank has deposit accounts whose ownership is based on a fiduciary relationship, Part 330 of the FDIC's regulations generally states that the titling of the deposit account (together with the underlying records) must indicate the existence of the fiduciary relationship in order for insurance coverage to be available on a "pass through" basis.  Fiduciary relationships include, but are not limited to, relationships involving a trustee, agent, nominee, guardian, executor, or custodian.  

A bank with fiduciary deposit accounts with balances of more than $250,000 must diligently use the available data on these deposit accounts, including data indicating the existence of different principal and income beneficiaries and data indicating that some or all of the funds on deposit represent retirement deposit accounts eligible for $250,000 in deposit insurance coverage, to determine its best estimate of the uninsured portion of these accounts.

(3)  If the bank has deposit accounts of employee benefit plans, Part 330 of the FDIC's regulations states that these accounts are insured on a "pass-through" basis for the non contingent interest of each plan participant provided that certain prescribed recordkeeping requirements are met.  A bank with employee benefit plan deposit accounts with balances of more than $250,000 must diligently use the available data on these deposit accounts to determine its best estimate of the uninsured portion of these accounts.

(4)  If the bank's deposit accounts include benefit-responsive "Depository Institution Investment Contracts," which must be included in Schedule RC-O, item 2, these deposit liabilities are not eligible for federal deposit insurance pursuant to Section 11(a)(8) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.  A bank with benefit-responsive "Depository Institution Investment Contracts" must include the entire amount of these contracts in the estimated amount of uninsured deposits it reports in this Memorandum item 2.

(5)  If the bank has deposit accounts with balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance limit that it has collateralized by pledging assets, such as deposits of the U.S. Government and of states and political subdivisions in the U.S. (which must be reported in Schedule RC-E, items 2 and 3, and, on the FFIEC 031 report form, in Schedule RC E, part II, item 5), the bank should make a reasonable estimate of the portion of these deposits that is uninsured using the data available from its information systems.

(6)  If the bank has deposit accounts with balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance limit for which it has acquired private deposit insurance to cover this excess amount, the bank should make a reasonable estimate of the portion of these deposits that is not insured by the FDIC using the data available from its information systems.

(7)  For all other deposit accounts, the bank should make a reasonable estimate of the portion of these deposits that is uninsured using the data available from its information systems.  In developing this estimate, if the bank has automated information systems in place that enable it to identify jointly owned accounts and estimate the deposit insurance coverage of these deposits, the higher level of insurance afforded these joint accounts should be taken into consideration.  Similarly, if the bank has automated information systems in place that enable it to classify accounts by deposit owner and/or ownership capacity, the bank should incorporate this information into its estimate of the amount of uninsured deposits by aggregating accounts held by the same deposit owner in the same ownership capacity before applying the $250,000 insurance limit.  Ownership capacities include, but are not limited to, single ownership, joint ownership, business (excluding sole proprietorships), revocable trusts, irrevocable trusts, and retirement accounts.

In the absence of automated information systems, a bank may use nonautomated information such as paper files or less formal knowledge of its depositors if such information provides reasonable estimates of appropriate portions of its uninsured deposits.  A bank's use of such nonautomated sources of information is considered appropriate unless errors associated with the use of such sources would contribute significantly to an overall error in the FDIC's estimate of the amount of insured and uninsured deposits in the banking system.

Any accrued and unpaid interest on the allowable exclusions listed below should also be reported in this item as an allowable exclusion.

The allowable exclusions include:

(1)  Foreign Deposits:  As defined in Section 3(l)(5) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, foreign deposits include

	(A)  any obligation of a depository institution which is carried on the books and records of an office of such bank or savings association located outside of any State, unless -

		(i)  such obligation would be a deposit if it were carried on the books and records of the depository institution, and would be payable at, an office located in any State; and

		(ii)  the contract evidencing the obligation provides by express terms, and not by implication, for payment at an office of the depository institution located in any State; and

	(B)  any international banking facility deposit, including an international banking facility time deposit, as such term is from time to time defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in regulation D or any successor regulation issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

NOTE:  Foreign deposits are deposit obligations under the FDIC certificate number of the reporting bank only.  Deposit obligations of a subsidiary depository institution chartered in a foreign country should not be included in amounts reported in Schedule RC-O under the domestic bank's FDIC certificate number.

(2)  Reciprocal balances:  Any demand deposit due from or cash item in the process of collection due from any depository institution (not including a foreign bank or foreign office of another U.S. depository institution) up to the total amount of deposit balances due to and cash items in the process of collection due such depository institution.

(3)  Drafts drawn on other depository institutions:  Any outstanding drafts (including advices and authorization to charge the depository institution's balance in another bank) drawn in the regular course of business by the reporting depository institution.

(4)  Pass-through reserve balances:  Reserve balances passed through to the Federal Reserve by the reporting institution that are also reflected as deposit liabilities of the reporting institution.  This exclusion is not applicable to an institution that does not act as a correspondent bank in any pass-through reserve balance relationship.  A state nonmember bank generally cannot act as a pass-through correspondent unless it maintains an account for its own reserve balances directly with the Federal Reserve.

(5)  Depository institution investment contracts:  Liabilities arising from depository institution investment contracts that are not treated as insured deposits under section 11(a)(5) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(a)(5)).  A Depository Institution Investment Contract is a separately negotiated depository agreement between an employee benefit plan and an insured depository institution that guarantees a specified rate for all deposits made over a prescribed period and expressly permits benefit-responsive withdrawals or transfers.

(6)  Accumulated deposits:  Deposits accumulated for the payment of personal loans that are assigned or pledged to assure payment of the loans at maturity.  Deposits that simply serve as collateral for loans are not an allowable exclusion.</label>

Averaging methods - An institution that reported $1 billion or more in quarter-end consolidated total assets in its Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Schedule RC, item 12, "Total assets") or Thrift Financial Report (Schedule SC, line item SC60, "Total assets") for March 31, 2011, and any institution that becomes FDIC-insured after March 31, 2011, must report average consolidated total assets in this item on a daily average basis.  An institution that reported less than $1 billion in quarter-end consolidated total assets in its Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Schedule RC, item 12, "Total assets") or Thrift Financial Report (Schedule SC, line item SC60, "Total assets") for March 31, 2011, may report average consolidated total assets in this item on a weekly average basis, or it may at any time opt permanently to report average consolidated total assets on a daily average basis.  Once an institution that reports average consolidated total assets using a weekly average reports average consolidated total assets of $1 billion or more in this item for two consecutive quarters, it must permanently report average consolidated total assets using daily averaging beginning the next quarter.

Daily average consolidated total assets should be calculated by adding the institution's consolidated total assets as of the close of business for each day of the calendar quarter and dividing by the number of days in the calendar quarter (the number of days in a quarter ranges from 90 days to 92 days).  For days that an institution is closed (e.g., Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays), the amount from the previous business day would be used.  An institution is considered closed if there are no transactions posted to the general ledger as of that date. 

Weekly average consolidated total assets should be calculated by adding the institution's consolidated total assets as of the close of business on each Wednesday during the calendar quarter and dividing by the number of Wednesdays in the quarter. 

An institution that becomes newly insured and begins operating during the calendar quarter should report average consolidated total assets on a daily average basis.  Daily average consolidated total assets for such an institution should be calculated by adding the institution's consolidated total assets as of the close of business for each day during the quarter since it became insured and operational, and dividing by the number of calendar days since it became insured and operational. 

Measuring consolidated total assets - Consolidated total assets should be measured in accordance with the instructions for Schedule RC-K, item 9, average "Total assets," except as follows:

(1)  If the reporting institution has an FDIC-insured depository institution subsidiary, the subsidiary should not be consolidated.  Instead, the reporting institution's investment in this subsidiary should be included in average consolidated total assets using the equity method of accounting. 

(2)  If the reporting institution is the surviving or resulting institution in a merger or consolidation that occurred during the calendar quarter, the reporting institution should calculate its average consolidated total assets by including the consolidated total assets of all entities that were merged or consolidated into the reporting institution as if the merger or consolidation occurred on the first day of the calendar quarter.  Acceptable methods for including a merged or consolidated entity's consolidated total assets in this calculation for the days during the calendar quarter preceding the merger or consolidation date include using either (a) the acquisition date fair value of the merged or consolidated entity's consolidated total assets for all days (or all Wednesdays) during the calendar quarter preceding the acquisition date or (b) the merged or consolidated entity's consolidated total assets, as defined for Schedule RC-K, item 9, average "Total assets," for each day (or each Wednesday) during the calendar quarter preceding the acquisition date.

(3)  If the reporting institution was acquired in a transaction that became effective during the calendar quarter and push down accounting was used to account for the acquisition, the reporting institution should calculate its average consolidated total assets as if the acquisition occurred on the first day of the calendar quarter.  Acceptable methods for including the institution's consolidated total assets in this calculation for the days during the calendar quarter preceding the acquisition date include using either (a) the acquisition date fair value of the reporting institution's consolidated total assets for all days (or all Wednesdays) during the calendar quarter preceding the acquisition date or (b) the reporting institution's consolidated total assets, as defined for Schedule RC-K, item 9, average "Total assets," for each day (or each Wednesday) during the calendar quarter preceding the acquisition date.

For purposes of this item, tangible equity is defined as Tier 1 capital as set forth in the banking agencies' regulatory capital standards and reported in Schedule RC-R, item 11.  

Averaging methods - An institution that reported $1 billion or more in quarter-end consolidated total assets in its Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Schedule RC, item 12, "Total assets") or Thrift Financial Report (Schedule SC, line item SC60, "Total assets") for March 31, 2011, and any institution that becomes FDIC-insured after March 31, 2011, must report average tangible equity on a monthly average basis.  An institution that reported less than $1 billion in quarter-end consolidated total assets in its Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Schedule RC, item 12, "Total assets") or Thrift Financial Report (Schedule SC, line item SC60, "Total assets") for March 31, 2011, may report its quarter-end tangible equity rather than an average amount, or it may at any time opt permanently to report average tangible equity on a monthly average basis.  Once an institution that reports average consolidated total assets using a weekly average reports average consolidated total assets of $1 billion or more in Schedule RC-O, item 4, for two consecutive quarters, it must permanently report average tangible equity using monthly averaging beginning the next quarter.

Monthly average tangible equity should be calculated by adding Tier 1 capital as of each month-end date during the calendar quarter and dividing by three.  For example, monthly average tangible equity for June 30, 2011, would be the sum of Tier 1 capital as of April 30, May 31, and June 30, 2011, divided by three.  However, institutions required or electing to report average tangible equity on a monthly average basis normally are not required to perform monthly loan loss provision or deferred tax calculations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the first two months of a quarter.  Accordingly, such institutions may use one third of the amount of the provision for loan and lease losses and deferred tax expense (benefit) reported for the calendar quarter for purposes of estimating the retained earnings component of Tier 1 capital in each of the first two months of the quarter.

An institution that becomes newly insured and begins operating during the calendar quarter should report average tangible equity on a monthly average basis.  Monthly average tangible equity for such an institution should be calculated by adding the institution's Tier 1 capital as of each month-end date during the quarter since it became insured and operational, and dividing by the number of month-end dates since it became insured and operational.

Measuring tangible equity - Tangible equity should be measured in accordance with the instructions for Schedule RC-R, item 11, "Tier 1 capital," except as follows:

(1)  If the reporting institution has an FDIC-insured depository institution subsidiary, the subsidiary should not be consolidated.  Instead, the reporting institution should measure its equity capital and its Tier 1 capital by accounting for this subsidiary using the equity method of accounting. 

(2)  If the reporting institution is the surviving or resulting institution in a merger or consolidation that occurred after the end of the first month of the calendar quarter and it reports its average tangible equity on a monthly average basis, the reporting institution should calculate its average tangible equity as if the merger or consolidation occurred on the first day of the calendar quarter.  An acceptable method for measuring tangible equity for month-end dates during the calendar quarter preceding the merger or consolidation date would be to use the amount of Tier 1 capital for the month-end date immediately following the merger or consolidation date as the amount of Tier 1 capital for the month-end date or dates preceding the merger or consolidation date.  

(3)  If the reporting institution was acquired in a transaction that became effective after the end of the first month of the calendar quarter, push down accounting was used to account for the acquisition, and the institution reports its average tangible equity on a monthly average basis, the reporting institution should calculate its average tangible equity as if the acquisition occurred on the first day of the calendar quarter.  An acceptable method for measuring tangible equity for month-end dates during the calendar quarter preceding the acquisition date would be to use the amount of Tier 1 capital for the month-end date immediately following the acquisition date as the amount of Tier 1 capital for the month-end date or dates preceding the acquisition date.

If the reporting institution does not meet both of these criteria, it should answer "No" to item 10 and it should not complete items 10.a and 10.b.

The definition of "banker's bank" is set forth in 12 U.S.C. 24, which states that a banker's bank is an FDIC-insured bank where the stock of the bank or its parent holding company "is owned exclusively (except to the extent directors' qualifying shares are required by law) by depository institutions or depository institution holding companies (as defined in section 1813 of this title)" and the bank or its parent holding "company and all subsidiaries thereof are engaged exclusively in providing services to or for other depository institutions, their holding companies, and the officers, directors, and employees of such institutions and companies, and in providing correspondent banking services at the request of other depository institutions or their holding companies."

A bank that would otherwise meet the definition of a banker's bank, but has received funds from federal capital infusion programs (such as the Troubled Assets Relief Program and the Small Business Lending Fund), has stock owned by the FDIC as a result of bank failures, or has non-bank-owned stock resulting from equity compensation programs, is not excluded from the definition of a banker's bank for purposes of Schedule RC-O, item 10, provided the bank also meets the business conduct test.

To meet the business conduct test, which is set forth in Section 327.5(b)(3) of the FDIC's regulations, a bank must conduct 50 percent or more of its business with entities other than its parent holding company or entities other than those controlled either directly or indirectly by its parent holding company. Control has the same meaning as in section 3(w)(5) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(w)(5)).</label>

For a qualifying banker's bank that is a respondent in a pass-through reserve relationship with a correspondent bank, balances due from Federal Reserve Banks include the reserve balances the correspondent bank has passed through to a Federal Reserve Bank for the respondent banker's bank. Balances due from Federal Reserve Banks also include the qualifying banker's bank's excess balance accounts, which are limited-purpose accounts at Federal Reserve Banks for maintaining an institution's excess balances that are eligible to earn interest on their Federal Reserve balances.

Report in this item the custodial bank deduction limit, which equals the average amount of the institution's transaction account deposit liabilities identified by the institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary, custodial, or safekeeping account.  The titling of a transaction account or specific references in the deposit account documents should clearly demonstrate the link between the transaction account and a fiduciary, custodial, or safekeeping account.

For deposits in domestic offices, "transaction account" is defined in Federal Reserve Regulation D and in the Glossary entry for "deposits." In general, a transaction account is a deposit or account from which the depositor or account holder is permitted to make transfers or withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instruments, payment orders of withdrawal, telephone transfers, or other similar devices for the purpose of making payments or transfers to third persons or others or from which the depositor may make third party payments at an automated teller machine, a remote service unit, or another electronic device, including by debit card. For purposes of reporting the custodial bank deduction limit in this item, a custodial bank with deposits in foreign offices should include foreign office deposit liabilities with the characteristics of a transaction account that are linked to a fiduciary, custody, or safekeeping account.

Criticized and classified items exclude loans and securities reported as trading assets, and the amount recoverable on an on- or off-balance sheet item from the U.S. government, its agencies, or government-sponsored agencies, under guarantee or insurance provisions, including FDIC loss-sharing agreements.

For purposes of the criticized and classified items definition, Loss items include any items graded Loss that have not yet been written off against the allowance for loan and leases losses (or another valuation allowance) or charged directly to earnings, as appropriate.  However, because an item should be written off or charged off in the period in which the item is deemed Loss, the amount reported in Memorandum item 6.d, below, generally should be zero.

A marked-to-market counterparty position is equal to the sum of the net marked-to-market derivative exposures for each counterparty. The net marked-to-market derivative exposure equals the sum of all positive marked-to-market exposures net of legally enforceable netting provisions and net of all collateral held under a legally enforceable Credit Support Annex plus any exposure where excess collateral has been posted to the counterparty. For purposes of this item, a marked-to-market counterparty position less any credit valuation adjustment can never be less than zero.</label>

The specific representations and warranties may relate to the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, and the loan's compliance with specified underwriting standards. Under ASC Subtopic 450-20, Contingencies - Loss Contingencies (formerly FASB Statement No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies"), an institution is required to accrue loss contingencies relating to the representations and warranties made in connection with its mortgage securitization activities and mortgage loan sales when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
Report in the appropriate subitem the amount of representation and warranty reserves included in Schedule RC-G, item 4, "All other liabilities," that the institution maintains for 1-4 family residential mortgage loans sold, including those mortgage loans transferred in securitizations accounted for as sales.</label>

Nontraditional 1-4 family residential mortgage loans include all 1-4 family residential loan products (as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.c) that allow the borrower to defer repayment of principal or interest and includes all interest-only products, teaser rate mortgages, and negative amortizing mortgages, with the exception of home equity lines of credit and reverse mortgages.  Nontraditional 1-4 family residential mortgage loans do not include loans reported as trading assets in Schedule RC, item 5; conventional fully amortizing adjustable rate mortgage loans that do not have a teaser rate; and interest-only residential construction loans, but include conventional fully amortizing adjustable rate mortgage loans that have a teaser rate.

A teaser-rate mortgage loan is defined for assessment purposes as a mortgage with a discounted initial rate.  A discounted initial rate is an effective interest rate at the time of origination or refinancing that is less than the rate the bank is willing to accept for an otherwise similar extension of credit with comparable risk.  A mortgage loan is no longer considered a nontraditional 1-4 family residential mortgage loan once the teaser rate has expired, or in the case of an escalating interest rate, once the rate is no longer discounted and the borrower is making full principal and interest payments (has not been granted any principal and interest concessions).  Nontraditional 1-4 family residential mortgage loans can be reclassified as traditional loans once they become fully amortizing loans, provided they no longer have a teaser rate.

The amount to be reported in this item for higher-risk C&amp;I loans and securities should include purchased credit-impaired loans and securities as defined in ASC Subtopic 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly AICPA Statement of Position 03-3, "Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer"), provided the purchased credit-impaired loans and securities meet the definition of a higher-risk C&amp;I loan or security.

The amount to be reported in this item should exclude: 

(1)  Loans to individuals for commercial, industrial, and professional purposes.[1]
(2)  The maximum amounts recoverable on higher-risk C&amp;I loans and securities under guarantee or insurance provisions from the U.S. government, including the maximum amount recoverable under FDIC loss-sharing agreements.

(1)  The definition of leveraged loans and securities contained in the FDIC's final rule on assessments and large bank pricing, 76 Fed. Reg. 10672 (February 25, 2011), or 
(2)  The institution's then existing internal methodology for identifying leveraged loans.[2]

Alternatively, a reporting institution may opt to apply the definition of higher-rsk C&amp;I loans and securities in Appendix C to Subpart A to Part 327 of the FDIC's regulations to all of its C&amp;I loans and securities without regard to when the loan was originated or refinanced (i.e., whether the loan was originated or refinanced before or after April 1, 2013).

For securitizations issued before April 1, 2013, that contain leveraged loans or securities, the reporting institution must either:

This information is intended to supplement the amount of higher-risk consumer loans reported in Schedule RC-O, Memorandum items 7.a and 8.a, above, and should include all consumer loans, as defined for assessment purposes, regardless of whether they have a two-year PD of more than 20 percent.  Institutions must calculate the PD for each consumer loan in accordance with the requirements set forth in Appendix C to Subpart A to Part 327 of the FDIC's regulations.  When determining the PD band to which a consumer loan should be assigned, institutions must round the PD of the loan to the nearest hundredth of a percentage point (e.g., round a PD of 5.6789 percent to 5.68 percent).

Amounts reported in Memorandum item 18 will not be made available to the public on an individual institution basis.  

For assessment purposes, consumer loans are defined as loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties (as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.c) and loans and leases to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures (as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, items 6 and 10.a).  However, when completing Memorandum item 18, exclude:

(1) Consumer loans reported as trading assets in Schedule RC, item 5;

(2) The maximum amounts recoverable on consumer loans from the U.S. government under guarantee or insurance provisions, including the maximum amount recoverable under FDIC loss-sharing agreements; and 

(3) Consumer loans fully secured by cash collateral, provided the requirements regarding loans fully secured by cash collateral that are detailed in Appendix C to Subpart A to Part 327 of the FDIC's regulations are met.

(4) All securitizations.

The amounts to be reported in Memorandum item 18 should include purchased credit-impaired loans as defined in ASC Subtopic 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly AICPA Statement of Position 03-3, "Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer").

The total amount reported  in Memorandum item 18.j, column N, may be less than the balance sheet amount of consumer loans reported in Schedule RC-C, part I, due to the exclusions noted above as well as the reporting exceptions detailed in Appendix C to Subpart A to Part 327 of the FDIC's regulations.  

Column Instructions

Columns A through L, Two-Year Probability of Default:  Report each consumer loan by product type in the appropriate two-year PD band column based on the two-year PD assigned to the loan in accordance with the requirements in Appendix C to Subpart A to Part 327 of the FDIC's regulations, unless the loan is unscoreable.

Column M, Unscoreable:  Report in column M the total amount of unscoreable loans by product type.  Unscoreable loans are defined for assessment purposes as consumer loans where the available information about the borrower is insufficient to determine a credit score and, consequently, the loan cannot be assigned a two-year PD in accordance with the requirements in Appendix C to Subpart A to Part 327 of the FDIC's regulations.   
   
Column N, Total:  Report in column N the total amount of scoreable and unscoreable consumer loans by product type, i.e., the sum of columns A through M for each product type.

Column O, PDs Were Derived Using:  Report in column O for each product type the method or methods used to assign PDs to the consumer loans within that product type.  For each product type, enter a 1 in column O if the PDs assigned to the loans were derived using a credit score-to-default rate mapping provided by a third party vendor; enter a 2 in column O if the PDs assigned to the loans were derived using an internally developed mapping approach; and enter a 3 in column O if third party and internal mapping were applied to derive the PDs for different segments of loans within the product type.

An institution that is not an advanced approaches institution may make a one-time election to become subject to the AOCI-related adjustments in Schedule RC-R, items 9.a through 9.e. That is, such an institution may opt-out of the requirement to include most components of AOCI in common equity tier 1 capital (with the exception of accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges related to items that are not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet). An institution that makes an AOCI opt-out election must enter "1" for "Yes" in item 3.a. There are no transition provisions applicable to reporting Schedule RC-R, item 3, if an institution makes an AOCI opt-out election.

An institution (except an advanced approaches institution) must make its AOCI opt-out election on the institution's March 31, 2015, Call Report. For an institution that comes into existence after March 31, 2015, the AOCI opt-out election must be made on the institution's first Call Report. Each of the institution's depository institution subsidiaries, if any, must elect the same option as the institution.

Transition provisions: Report AOCI adjusted for the transition AOCI adjustment amount in
(cont.) Schedule RC-R, item 3, as described below. AOCI components must be reported net of deferred tax effects, as reported under GAAP:

(i) Determine the aggregate amount of the following items:
(1) Unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities that are preferred stock classified as an equity security under GAAP or available-for-sale equity exposures, plus
(2) Net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities that are not preferred stock classified as an equity security under GAAP or available-for-sale equity exposures, plus
(3) Any amounts recorded in AOCI attributed to defined benefit postretirement plans resulting from the initial and subsequent application of the relevant GAAP standards that pertain to such plans (excluding, at the reporting institution's option, the portion relating to pension assets deducted in Schedule RC-R, item 10.b.(2)), plus
(4) Accumulated net gains (losses) on cash flow hedges related to items that are reported on the balance sheet at fair value included in AOCI, plus
(5) Net unrealized gains (losses) on held-to-maturity securities that are included in AOCI.
(ii) Multiply the amount calculated in step (i) by the appropriate percentage in Table 1 below. This amount is the calendar-year transition AOCI adjustment amount.
(iii) Report in Schedule RC-R, item 3, the amount of AOCI reported in Schedule RC, item 26.b, minus the calendar-year transition AOCI adjustment amount calculated in step (ii).

Common equity tier 1 minority interest is the portion of common equity tier 1 capital in a reporting institution's subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the parent institution. Note that a bank may only include common equity tier 1 minority interest if: (a) the subsidiary is a depository institution or a foreign bank; and (b) the capital instruments issued by the subsidiary meet all of the criteria for common equity tier 1 capital (qualifying common equity tier 1 capital instruments). In general, the minority interest limitation applies only if a subsidiary has a surplus common equity tier 1 capital (that is, in excess of the subsidiary's minimum capital requirements and the applicable capital conservation buffer).

Example and a worksheet calculation: For each consolidated subsidiary that is a depository institution or a foreign bank, calculate common equity tier 1 minority interest includable at the reporting institution's level as follows:

Assumptions:
* Risk-weighted assets of the consolidated subsidiary are the same as the risk-weighted assets of the institution that relate to the subsidiary ($1,000);
* The subsidiary's common equity tier 1 capital is $80;
* The subsidiary's common equity tier 1 minority interest (that is, owned by minority shareholders) is $24.

(1)
Determine the risk-weighted assets of the subsidiary using the risk-based capital framework applicable to that subsidiary.
$1,000

(2)
Determine the risk-weighted assets of the institution that relate to the subsidiary depository institution. Note that the amount in this step (2) may differ from the amount in step (1) due to intercompany transactions and eliminations in consolidation.
$1,000

(3)
Determine the lower of (1) or (2), and multiply that amount by 7.0%.  The percentage multiplier in step (3) is the capital ratio necessary for the depository institution to avoid restrictions on distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Advanced approaches institutions must adjust this percentage to account for all the applicable buffers.
$1,000 x 7% = $70

(4)
Determine the dollar amount of the subsidiary's common equity tier 1 capital (assumed $80 in this example). If this amount is less than step (3), include this amount in Schedule RC-R, item 4. Otherwise, continue to step (5).
$80

(5)
Subtract the amount in step (3) from the amount in step (4). This is the "surplus common equity tier 1 capital of the subsidiary."
$80 - $70 = $10

(6)
Determine the percent of the subsidiary's common equity tier 1 capital owned by third parties (the minority shareholders).
$24/$80 = 30%

(7)
Multiply the percentage from step (6) by the dollar amount in step (5). This is the "surplus common equity tier 1 minority interest of the subsidiary," subject to the transition provisions below.
30% x $10 = $3

(8)
Subtract the amount in step (7) from the subsidiary's common equity tier 1 minority interest.
$24 - $3 = $21

(9)
This is the "common equity tier 1 minority interest includable at the reporting institution's level" to be included in Schedule RC-R, item 4, for this subsidiary.
$21

Transition provisions for surplus minority interest or non-qualifying minority interest:

a. Surplus minority interest:

An institution may include in common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital, or total capital the percentage of the common equity tier 1 minority interest, tier 1 minority interest and total capital minority interest outstanding as of January 1, 2014, that exceeds any common equity tier 1 minority interest, tier 1 minority interest or total capital minority interest includable under section 21 of the revised regulatory capital rules (surplus minority interest) as follows:

(i) Determine the amounts of outstanding surplus minority interest (for the case of common equity tier 1, tier 1, and total capital).
(ii) Multiply the amounts in (i) it by the appropriate percentage in Table 2 below.
(iii) Include the amounts in (ii) in the corresponding line items (that is, Schedule RC-R, item 4, item 22, or item 29).

In the worksheet calculation above, the transition provisions for surplus minority interest would apply at step (7). Specifically, if the institution has $3 of surplus common equity tier 1 minority interest of the subsidiary as of January 1, 2014, it may include $2.40 (that is, $3 multiplied by 80%) in Schedule RC-R, item 4, during calendar year 2014; $1.80 during calendar year 2015; $1.20 during calendar year 2016; $0.60 during calendar year 2017; and $0 starting on January 1, 2018.

b. Non-qualifying minority interest:

An institution may include in tier 1 capital or total capital the percentage of the tier 1 minority interest and total capital minority interest outstanding as of January 1, 2014, that does not meet the criteria for additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital instruments in section 20 of the revised regulatory capital rules (non-qualifying minority interest). The institution must phase-out non-qualifying minority interest in accordance with Table 2, using the following steps for each subsidiary:

(i) Determine the amounts of the outstanding non-qualifying minority interest (in the form of additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital).
(ii) Multiply the amounts in (i) by the appropriate percentage in Table 2 below.
(iii) Include the amounts in (ii) in the corresponding item (that is, Schedule RC-R, item 22 or item 29).

For example, if an institution has $10 of non-qualifying minority interest that previously qualified as tier 1 capital, it may include $8 (that is, $10 multiplied by 80%) during calendar year 2014, $6 during calendar year 2015, $4 during calendar year 2016, $2 during calendar year 2017, and $0 starting in January 1, 2018.

Common equity tier 1 capital: adjustments and deductions

Note 1: As described in section 22(b) of the revised regulatory capital rules, regulatory adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital must be made net of associated deferred tax effects.

Note 2: As described in section 22(e) of the revised regulatory capital rules, netting of deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) against assets that are subject to deduction is permitted if the following conditions are met:

(i) The DTL is associated with the asset;
(ii) The DTL would be extinguished if the associated asset becomes impaired or is derecognized under GAAP; and
(iii) A DTL can only be netted against a single asset.

The amount of deferred tax assets (DTAs) that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, net of any related valuation allowances, and of DTAs arising from temporary differences that the institution could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks, net of any related valuation allowances, may be offset by DTLs (that have not been netted against assets subject to deduction) subject to the following conditions:

(i) Only the DTAs and DTLs that relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and that are eligible for offsetting by that authority may be offset for purposes of this deduction.
(ii) The amount of DTLs that the institution nets against DTAs that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, net of any related valuation allowances, and against DTAs arising from temporary differences that the institution could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks, net of any related valuation allowances, must be allocated in proportion to the amount of DTAs that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards (net of any related valuation allowances, but before any offsetting of DTLs) and of DTAs arising from temporary differences that the institution could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks (net of any related valuation allowances, but before any offsetting of DTLs), respectively.

An institution may offset DTLs embedded in the carrying value of a leveraged lease portfolio acquired in a business combination that are not recognized under GAAP against DTAs that are subject to section 22(a) of the revised regulatory capital rules in accordance with section 22(e).

An institution must net DTLs against assets subject to deduction in a consistent manner from reporting period to reporting period. An institution may change its DTL netting preference only after obtaining the prior written approval of the primary federal supervisor.

In addition, note that even though certain deductions may be net of associated DTLs, the risk-weighted portion of those items may not be reduced by the associated DTLs.</label>

However, if the institution has a DTL that is specifically related to goodwill acquired in a taxable purchase business combination that it chooses to net against the goodwill, the amount of disallowed goodwill to be reported in this item should be reduced by the amount of the associated DTL.

If an institution has significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock, the institution should report in this item goodwill embedded in the valuation of a significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution in the form of common stock (embedded goodwill). Such deduction of embedded goodwill would apply to investments accounted for under the equity method. Under GAAP, if there is a difference between the initial cost basis of the investment and the amount of underlying equity in the net assets of the investee, the resulting difference should be accounted for as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary (which may include imputed goodwill).

If an institution does not have a sufficient amount of tier 2 capital to reflect these deductions, then the institution must deduct the shortfall from additional tier 1 capital (Schedule RC-R, item 24) or, if there is not enough additional tier 1 capital, from common equity tier 1 capital (Schedule RC-R, item 17).

For example, if tier 2 capital is $98, and if the bank must make $110 in tier 2 deductions, it would report $98 on line 33, and would take the additional $12 deduction in Schedule RC-R, item 24 (and in Schedule RC-R, item 17, in the case of insufficient additional tier 1 capital to make the deduction in Schedule RC-R, item 24).

In addition, advanced approaches institutions with insufficient tier 2 capital for deductions will make the following adjustments: an advanced approaches institution will make deductions on this schedule under the generally applicable rules that apply to all institutions. It will use FFIEC 101 Schedule A, to calculate its capital requirements under the advanced approaches. Therefore, in the case of an advanced approaches institution with insufficient tier 2 capital to make tier 2 deductions, it will use the corresponding deduction approach and the generally applicable rules to take excess tier 2 deductions from additional tier 1 capital in Schedule RC-R, item 24, and if necessary from common equity tier 1 capital in Schedule RC-R, item 17. It will use the advanced approaches rules to take deductions on the FFIEC 101 form.

For example, assume tier 2 capital is $100 under the advanced approaches and $98 under the generally applicable rules (due to the difference between the amount of eligible credit reserves includable in tier 2 capital under the advanced approaches, and ALLL includable in tier 2 capital under the standardized approach). If the required deduction from tier 2 capital is $110, then the advanced approaches institution would add $10 to the required additional tier 1 capital deductions (on FFIEC 101 Schedule A, item 42, and FFIEC 101 Schedule A, item 27, if necessary), and would add $12 to its required additional tier 1 capital deductions for the calculation of the standardized approach regulatory capital ratios in this schedule (Schedule RC-R, item 24, and Schedule RC-R, item 17, if necessary).

(1) Investments in own additional tier 2 capital instruments. Report the institution's investments in (including any contractual obligation to purchase) its own tier 2 instruments, whether held directly or indirectly.

An institution may deduct gross long positions net of short positions in the same underlying instrument only if the short positions involve no counterparty risk.

The institution must look through any holdings of index securities to deduct investments in its own capital instruments. In addition:

(i) Gross long positions in investments in an institution's own regulatory capital instruments resulting from holdings of index securities may be netted against short positions in the same index;
(ii) Short positions in index securities that are hedging long cash or synthetic positions can be decomposed to recognize the hedge; and
(iii) The portion of the index that is composed of the same underlying exposure that is being hedged may be used to offset the long position if both the exposure being hedged and the short position in the index are covered positions under the market risk capital rule, and the hedge is deemed effective by the institution's internal control processes.

Transition provisions: Follow the transition provisions in Schedule RC-R, item 11.

(2) Reciprocal cross-holdings in the capital of financial institutions. Include investments in the tier 2 capital instruments of other financial institutions that the institution holds reciprocally, where such reciprocal crossholdings result from a formal or informal arrangement to swap, exchange, or otherwise intend to hold each other's capital instruments.

Transition provisions: Follow the transition provisions in Schedule RC-R, item 11.

(3) Non-significant investments in tier 2 capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that exceed the 10 percent threshold for non-significant investments.

Calculate this amount as follows (similar to Schedule RC-R, item 11):

(1) Determine the aggregate amount of non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock, additional tier 1, and tier 2 capital.
(2) Determine the amount of non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of tier 2 capital.
(3) If (1) is greater than the ten percent threshold for non-significant investments (Schedules RC-R, item 11, step (4)), then, multiply the difference by the ratio of (2) over (1). Report this product in this item.
(4) If (1) is less than the ten percent threshold for non-significant investments, enter zero.

For example, assume an institution has a total of $200 in non-significant investments (step 1), including $40 in the form of tier 2 capital (step 2), and its ten percent threshold for non-significant investments is $100 (as calculated in Schedule RC-R, item 11, step 4). Since the aggregate amount of non-significant investments exceed the ten percent threshold for non-significant investments by $100 ($200-$100), the institution would multiply $100 by the ratio of 40/200 (step 3). Thus, the institution would need to deduct $20 from its tier 2 capital.

Transition provisions: Follow the transition provisions in Schedule RC-R, item 11.

(4) Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common stock to be deducted from tier 2 capital. Report the total amount of significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of tier 2 capital.

Transition provisions: Follow the transition provisions in Schedule RC-R, item 11.

(5) Other adjustments and deductions. Include any other applicable adjustments and deductions applied to tier 2 capital in accordance with the revised regulatory capital rules of the primary federal supervisor.</label>

None of the institution's allocated transfer risk reserve, if any, is includable in tier 2 capital.

Advanced approaches institutions only: During the reporting periods in 2014, the amount reported in this item cannot exceed 1.25 percent of the institution's gross risk-weighted assets as determined under sections 20(d) and 22 of the revised regulatory capital rules. The starting point for this calculation is risk-weighted assets calculated under the general risk-based capital rules reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 59, less market risk equivalent assets reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 58. The resulting amount must be adjusted as follows:

(a) Add the amount of the following items reported in item 42, column B (All other assets) of Schedule RC-R, Part II: any disallowed goodwill and other intangible assets reported; disallowed servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships; disallowed deferred tax; and the equity investments in unconsolidated banking and finance subsidiaries that are reported in Schedule RC, item 8, and are deducted for risk-based capital purposes in Schedule RC-R, Part I.B, item 10.b; and

(b) Subtract amounts deducted under section 22(a) of the revised regulatory capital rules (Schedule RC-R, Part I.B, items 6 through 8, and the amounts reported in 10.b for after-tax gain-on-sale in connection with a securitization exposure; defined benefit pension fund assets, net of associated DTLs; equity investments in financial subsidiaries, and, for advanced approaches institutions only that exit parallel run, the amount of expected credit loss that exceeds the institution's eligible credit reserves). These subtractions must be done in accordance with the applicable transition provisions of the revised regulatory capital rules.

The allowance for loan and lease losses equals Schedule RC, item 4.c, "Allowance for loan and lease losses," less Schedule RI-B, part II, Memorandum item 1, "Allocated transfer risk reserve included in Schedule RI-B, part II, item 7, above," plus Schedule RC-G, item 3, "Allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures."

All institutions: Starting on January 1, 2015, the amount reported in this item cannot exceed 1.25 percent of the institution's risk-weighted assets base for the ALLL calculation reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II. In calculating the risk-weighted assets base for this purpose, an institution would not include items that are deducted from capital under section 22(a). However, an institution would include risk-weighted asset amounts of items deducted from capital under sections 22(c) through (f) of the revised regulatory capital rule, in accordance with the applicable transition provisions. While amounts deducted from capital under sections 22(c) through (f) are included in the risk-weighted asset base for the ALLL calculation, such amounts are excluded from standardized total risk-weighted assets used in the denominator of the risk-based capital ratios.

The allowance for loan and lease losses equals Schedule RC, item 4.c, "Allowance for loan and lease losses," less Schedule RI-B, part II, Memorandum item 1, "Allocated transfer risk reserve included in Schedule RI-B, part II, item 7, above," plus Schedule RC-G, item 3, "Allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures."</label>

Note: Advanced approaches institutions, including those that have not exited parallel run, will need to consult the regulation for the transition period if the countercyclical buffer is in place or if the institution is subject to countercyclical buffers in other jurisdictions. Starting on January 1, 2016, any countercyclical buffer amount applicable to an advanced approaches institution should be added to the amount applicable in Table 10, in order for that institution to determine if it will need to complete Schedule RC-R, items 47 and 48.</label>

Notes:
1. Refer to the definition of "residential mortgage exposure" in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules, and refer to the requirements for risk weighting residential mortgage loans in section 32 of the regulatory capital rules. 
2.  A residential mortgage loan may receive a 50 percent risk weight if it meets the qualifying criteria in section 32(g) of the regulatory capital rules:  
   * A property is owner-occupied or rented; 
   * The loan is prudently underwritten including the loan amount as a percentage of the appraised value of the real estate collateral.  
   * The loan is not 90 days or more past due or on nonaccrual; 
   * The loan is not restructured or modified (except for loans restructured solely pursuant to the U.S. Treasury's HAMP). 
   * If the bank holds the first lien and junior lien(s) on a residential mortgage exposure, and no other party holds an intervening lien, the bank must combine the exposures and treat them as a single first-lien residential mortgage exposure.
4.  A first lien home equity line (HELOC) may qualify for 50 percent risk weight if it meets the qualifying criteria.
5.  A residential mortgage loan of $1 million or less on a property of more than 4 units may qualify for 50 percent risk weight if it meets the qualifying criteria. 


* In column I-100% risk weight, include the carrying value of HFS loans that are residential mortgage exposures reported in Schedule RC, item 4.a, that are not included in columns C, G, H, or R.  Also include the portion of any exposure that meets the definition of residential mortgage exposure or statutory multifamily mortgage reported in Schedule RC, item 4.a, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 100 percent risk weight.

* In columns R and S-Application of Other Risk-Weighting Approaches, include the portion of any HFS exposure reported in Schedule RC, item 4.a, that meets the definition of residential mortgage exposure or statutory multifamily mortgage  and is secured by qualifying financial collateral that meets the definition of a securitization exposure in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules or is a mutual fund only if the bank chooses to recognize the risk-mitigating effects of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral under the Simple Approach outlined in section 37 of the regulatory capital rules.  Under the Simple Approach, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of the exposure may not be less than 20 percent.
   * Include in column R the carrying value of the portion of an HFS exposure that is secured by the fair value of securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that meets the general requirements of the Simple Approach in section 37.  In addition, the bank must apply the same approach to securitization exposure collateral - either the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach or the Gross-Up Approach - that it applies to determine the risk-weighted asset amounts of its on- and off-balance sheet securitization exposures that are reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 9 and 10.
   * Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that collateralizes the portion of the HFS exposure secured by such collateral.

[14]  HVCRE exposure means a credit facility that, prior to conversion to permanent financing, finances or has financed the acquisition, development, or construction (ADC) of real property, unless the facility finances: 
(1) One- to four-family residential properties;
(2) Real property that:
	(i) would qualify as an investment in community development under 12 U.S.C. 338a or 12 U.S.C. 24 (Eleventh), as applicable, or as a "qualified investment" under [12 CFR part 25 (national bank), 12 CFR part 195 (federal savings association) (OCC); 12 CFR part 228 (Board); 12 CFR part 345 (FDIC)], and 
	(ii) is not an ADC loan to any entity described in [12 CFR part 25.12(g)(3) (national banks) and 12 CFR 195.12(g)(3) (federal savings associations) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.22(a)(3) or 228.12(g)(3) (Board); 12 CFR 345.12(g)(3) (FDIC)], unless it is otherwise described in paragraph (1), (2)(i), (3) or (4) of this definition;
(3) The purchase or development of agricultural land, which includes all land known to be used or usable for agricultural purposes (such as crop and livestock production), provided that the valuation of the agricultural land is based on its value for agricultural purposes and the valuation does not take into consideration any potential use of the land for non-agricultural commercial development or residential development; or
(4) Commercial real estate projects in which: 
	(i) the loan-to-value ratio is less than or equal to the applicable maximum supervisory loan-to-value ratio in the real estate lending standards at [12 CFR part 34, subpart D (national banks) and 12 CFR part 160, subparts A and B (federal savings associations) (OCC); 12 CFR part 208, appendix C (Board); 12 CFR part 365, subpart A (state nonmember banks) and 12 CFR 390.264 and 390.265 (state savings associations) (FDIC)]; 
	(ii) The borrower has contributed capital to the project in the form of cash or unencumbered readily marketable asset (or has paid development expenses out-of-pocket) of at least 15 percent of the real estate's appraised "as completed" value; and
	(iii) The borrower contributed the amount of capital required by paragraph (4)(ii) of this definition before the bank advances funds under the credit facility, and the capital contributed by the borrower, or internally generated by the project, is contractually required to remain in the project throughout the life of the project.

For each consolidated subsidiary, perform the calculations in steps (1) through (10) below. Sum up the results for each consolidated subsidiary and report the aggregate number in this item 29.

Example and a worksheet calculation: Calculate total capital minority interest that is not included in tier 1 capital includable at the institution level as follows:

Assumptions:
* This is a continuation of the example used in the instructions for Schedule RC-R, items 4 and 22.
* Assume that risk-weighted assets of the subsidiary are the same as the risk-weighted assets of the institution that relate to the subsidiary: $1,000 in each case.
* Subsidiary's total capital: $130, which is composed of subsidiary's common equity tier 1 capital $80, and additional tier 1 capital of $30, and tier 2 capital of $20.
* Subsidiary's common equity tier 1 capital owned by minority shareholders: $24.
* Subsidiary's additional tier 1 capital owned by minority shareholders: $15.
* Subsidiary's total capital instruments owned by minority shareholders: $15.

(1)
Determine the risk-weighted assets of the subsidiary.
$1,000

(2)
Determine the risk-weighted assets of the institution that relate to the subsidiary. Note that the amount in this step (2) may differ from the amount in step (1) due to intercompany transactions and eliminations in consolidation.
$1,000

(3)
Determine the lower of (1) or (2), and multiply that amount by 10.5%.  The percentage multiplier in step (3) is the capital ratio necessary for a subsidiary depository institution to avoid restrictions on distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Advanced approaches institutions must adjust this amount for all applicable buffers.
$1,000 x 10.5% = $105

(4)
Determine the dollar amount of total capital for the subsidiary. If this amount is less than step (3), go directly to step (9). Otherwise continue on to step (5).
$130

(5)
Subtract the amount in step (3) from the amount in step (4). This is the "surplus total capital of the subsidiary."
$130-$105= $25

(6)
Determine the percent of the subsidiary's total capital instruments that are owned by third parties (the minority shareholders).
$24 + $15 + $15 = $54. Then $54/$130 = 41.54%

(7)
Multiply the percentage from step (6) by the dollar amount in step (5). This is the "surplus total capital minority interest of the subsidiary"
41.54% x $25 = $10.39

(8)
Determine the total amount of total capital minority interest of the subsidiary. Then subtract the surplus total capital minority interest of the subsidiary (step 7) from this amount.
$24 + $15 + $15 = $54. Then $54 - $10.39 = $43.62.

(9)
The "total capital minority interest includable at the institution level" is the amount from step (8) or step (4) where there is no surplus total capital minority interest of the subsidiary.
$43.62 (report the lesser of $43.62 or $54).

(10)
Subtract from (9) any minority interest that is included in common equity tier 1 and additional tier 1 capital. The result is the total capital minority interest not included in tier 1 capital includable in total capital.
$43.62 - ($21 + $9.14) = $13.48.

Transition provisions: For surplus minority interest and non-qualifying minority interest that can be included in tier 2 capital during the transition period, follow the transition provisions instructions for Schedule RC-R, item 4 after taking into consideration (that is, excluding) any amount of surplus tier 1 minority interest (see step 7 of the worksheet in item 22). In the example (and assuming no outstanding amounts of non-qualifying minority interest), the institution has $1.53 of surplus total capital minority interest available to be included during the transition period in tier 2 capital ($10.39 (see step 7 of the worksheet in item 29) of surplus total capital minority interest minus $8.86 (see step 7 of the worksheet in item 22) of tier 1 minority interest). In 2015, the institution would include an additional $0.92 in item 29 (60% of $1.53) and starting in 2018 the institution would not include any surplus minority interest in its regulatory capital.</label>

Note that if an institution does not have a sufficient amount of additional tier 1 capital to reflect these deductions, then the institution must deduct the shortfall from common equity tier 1 capital (Schedule RC-R, item 17).

(1) Investments in own additional tier 1 capital instruments. Report the institution's investments in (including any contractual obligation to purchase) its own additional tier 1 instruments, whether held directly or indirectly.

An institution may deduct gross long positions net of short positions in the same underlying instrument only if the short positions involve no counterparty risk.

The institution must look through any holdings of index securities to deduct investments in its own capital instruments. In addition:

(i) Gross long positions in investments in an institution's own regulatory capital instruments resulting from holdings of index securities may be netted against short positions in the same index;
(ii) Short positions in index securities that are hedging long cash or synthetic positions can be decomposed to recognize the hedge; and
(iii) The portion of the index that is composed of the same underlying exposure that is being hedged may be used to offset the long position if both the exposure being hedged and the short position in the index are covered positions under the market risk capital rule, and the hedge is deemed effective by the institution's internal control processes.

Transition provisions: Follow the transition provisions in Schedule RC-R, item 11.

(2) Reciprocal cross-holdings in the capital of financial institutions. Include investments in the additional tier 1 capital instruments of other financial institutions that the institution holds reciprocally, where such reciprocal crossholdings result from a formal or informal arrangement to swap, exchange, or otherwise intend to hold each other's capital instruments. If the institution does not have a sufficient amount of a specific component of capital to effect the required deduction, the shortfall must be deducted from the next higher (that is, more subordinated) component of regulatory capital.

For example, if an institution is required to deduct a certain amount from additional tier 1 capital and it does not have additional tier 1 capital, then the deduction should be from common equity tier 1 capital in Schedule RC-R, item 17.

Transition provisions: Follow the transition provisions in Schedule RC-R, item 11.

(3) Non-significant investments in additional tier 1 capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that exceed the 10 percent threshold for non-significant investments. As noted in the instructions for RC-R, item 11 above, an institution has a non-significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution if it owns 10 percent or less of the issued and outstanding common shares of that institution. Calculate this amount as follows:

(1) Determine the aggregate amount of non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock, additional tier 1, and tier 2 capital.
(2) Determine the amount of non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of additional tier 1 capital.
(3) If the amount in (1) is greater than the ten percent threshold for non-significant investments (Schedules RC-R, item 11, step (4)), then multiply the difference by the ratio of (2) over (1). Report this product in this item 24.
(4) If the amount in (1) is less than the 10 percent threshold for non-significant investments, report zero.

For example, assume an institution has a total of $200 in non-significant investments (step 1), including $60 in the form of additional tier 1 capital (step 2), and its ten percent threshold for non-significant investments is $100 (as calculated in step 4 of item 11). Since the aggregate amount of non-significant investments exceeds the ten percent threshold for non-significant investments by $100 ($200-$100), the institution would multiply $100 by the ratio of 60/200 (step 3). Thus, the institution would need to deduct $30 from its additional tier 1 capital.

Transition provisions: Follow the transition provisions in Schedule RC-R, item 11.

(4) Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common stock to be deducted from additional tier 1 capital. Report the total amount of significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of additional tier 1 capital.

Transition provisions: Follow the transition provisions in Schedule RC-R, item 11.

(5) Other adjustments and deductions. Include adjustments and deductions applied to additional tier 1 capital due to insufficient tier 2 capital to cover deductions (related to reciprocal cross holdings, non-significant investments in the tier 2 capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, and significant investments in the tier 2 capital of unconsolidated financial institutions).

Also include adjustments and deductions related to the calculation of DTAs, gain-on-sale, defined benefit pension fund assets, changes in fair value of liabilities due to changes in own credit risk, and expected credit losses during the transition period described in Schedule RC-R, item 8.

In addition, insured state banks with real estate subsidiaries whose continued operations have been approved by the FDIC pursuant to Section 362.4 of the FDIC's Rules and Regulations generally should include as a deduction from additional tier 1 capital their equity investment in the subsidiary. (Insured state banks with FDIC-approved phase-out plans for real estate subsidiaries need not make these deductions.) Insured state banks with other subsidiaries (that are not financial subsidiaries) whose continued operations have been approved by the FDIC pursuant to Section 362.4 should include as a deduction from additional Tier 1 capital the amount required by the approval order.</label>

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-line-772145_lbl_1447" xml:lang="en">Report the amount of tier 1 minority interest not included in common equity tier 1 capital that is includable at the consolidated level, as described below.

For each consolidated subsidiary, perform the calculations in steps (1) through (10) of the worksheet below. Sum up the results from step 10 for each consolidated subsidiary and report the aggregate number in this item 22.

For tier 1 minority interest, there is no requirement that the subsidiary be a depository institution or a foreign bank. However, the instrument that gives rise to tier 1 minority interest must meet all the criteria for either common equity tier 1 capital or additional tier 1 capital instrument.

Example and a worksheet calculation: calculate tier 1 minority interest not included in common equity tier 1 capital includable at the institution level as follows:

Assumptions:
* This is a continuation of the example used for common equity tier 1 minority interest from Schedule RC, item 4. Assume that risk-weighted assets of the subsidiary are the same as the risk-weighted assets of the institution that relate to the subsidiary: $1,000 in each case.
* Subsidiary's tier 1 capital: $110, which is composed of subsidiary's common equity tier 1 capital $80 and additional tier 1 capital of $30.
* Subsidiary's common equity tier 1 owned by minority shareholders: $24.
* Subsidiary's additional tier 1 capital owned by minority shareholders: $15
* Other relevant numbers are taken from the example in Schedule RC-R, item 4.

(1)
Determine the risk-weighted assets of the subsidiary.
$1,000

(2)
Determine the risk-weighted assets of the institution that relate to the subsidiary. Note that the amount in this step (2) may differ from the amount in step (1) due to intercompany transactions and eliminations in consolidation.
$1,000

(3)
Multiply the lower of (1) or (2) by 8.5%.  The percentage multiplier in step (3) is the capital ratio necessary for the subsidiary depository institution to avoid restrictions on distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Advanced approaches institutions must adjust this percentage to account for all applicable buffers.
$1,000 x 8.5% = $85

(4)
Determine the dollar amount of tier 1 capital for the subsidiary. If this amount is less than step (3), go directly to step (9). Otherwise continue on to step (5).
$110

(5)
Subtract the amount in step (3) from the amount in step (4). This is the "surplus tier 1 capital of the subsidiary."
$110 - $85 = $25

(6)
Determine the percent of the subsidiary's qualifying capital instruments that are owned by third parties (the minority shareholders).
$24 + 15 = $39. Then $39/$110 = 35.45%

(7)
Multiply the percentage from step (6) by the dollar amount in step (5). This is the "surplus tier 1 minority interest of the subsidiary."
35.45% x $25 = $8.86

(8)
Determine the total amount of tier 1 minority interest of the subsidiary. Then subtract the surplus tier 1 minority interest of the subsidiary (step 7) from this amount.
$24 + $15 = $39. Then $39 - $8.86 = $30.14

(9)
The "tier 1 minority interest includable at the reporting institution's level" is the amount from step (8) (or from step (4) when there is no surplus tier 1 minority interest of the subsidiary).
$30.14

(10)
Subtract any minority interest that is included in common equity tier 1 capital (from Schedule RC-R, item 4). The result is the minority interest included in additional tier 1 capital.
$30.14 - $21 (from example in item 4) = $9.14.

Note: As indicated, this example built onto the example under the instructions for item 4, where the subsidiary was a depository institution, and where its common equity tier 1 minority interest was includable in common equity tier 1 capital. However, if this were a subsidiary other than a depository institution, none of its minority interest arising from common equity tier 1 would have been includable in common equity tier 1 capital. If the subsidiary in the example were not a depository institution, the full calculated amount of minority interest ($30.14) would be includable in additional tier 1 capital of the reporting institution since none of it would have been includable in common equity tier 1 capital.

Transition provisions: For surplus minority interest and non-qualifying minority interest that can be included in additional tier 1 capital during the transition period, follow the transition provisions instructions for Schedule RC-R, item 4 after taking into consideration (that is, excluding) any amount of surplus common equity tier 1 minority interest (see step 7 of the worksheet in item 4). In the example (and assuming no outstanding amounts of non-qualifying minority interest), the institution has $5.86 of surplus tier 1 minority interest available to be included during the transition period in additional tier 1 capital ($8.86 (see  step 7 of the worksheet in item 22) of surplus tier 1 minority interest minus $3.00 (see step 7 of the worksheet in item 4) of common equity tier 1 minority interest). In 2015, the institution would include an additional $3.52 in item 22 (60% of $5.86) and starting in 2018 the institution would not include any surplus minority interest in regulatory capital.</label>

The amount of non-qualifying capital instruments that is excluded from additional tier 1 capital in accordance with Table 7 may be included in tier 2 capital (in Schedule RC-R, item 28) without limitation, provided the instruments meet the criteria for tier 2 capital set forth in section 20(d) of the revised regulatory capital rules.

Transition provisions for non-qualifying capital instruments includable in additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital:

Table 7 applies separately to additional tier 1 and tier 2 non-qualifying capital instruments. For example, an advanced approaches institution that has $100 in non-qualifying tier 1 instruments may include up to $80 in additional tier 1 capital in 2014, and $70 in 2015. If that same institution has $100 in non-qualifying tier 2 instruments, it may include up to $80 in tier 2 capital in 2014 and $70 in 2015.

If the institution is involved in a merger or acquisition, it should treat its non-qualifying capital instruments following the requirements in section 300 of the revised regulatory capital rules.

Transition provisions:

A. From January 1, 2014, until January 1, 2018, calculate this item 16 as follows:
(i) Calculate the aggregate amount of the threshold items before deductions:
a. Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock net of associated DTLs (Schedule RC-R, item 13, step 1);
b. MSAs net of associated DTLs (Schedule RC-R, item 14, step 1); and
c. DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks net of any related valuation allowance and net of DTLs (Schedule RC-R, item 15, step 1).
(ii) Multiply the amount in Schedule RC-R, item 12 (Subtotal) by 15 percent. This is the 15 percent common equity deduction threshold for transition purposes.
(iii) Sum up the amounts reported in Schedule RC-R, items 13, 14, and 15.
(iv) Deduct (iii) from (i).
(v) Deduct (ii) from (iv).
(vi) Multiply the amount in (iv) by the percentage in Table 6, in Schedule RC-R, item 13. Report the resulting amount in this item 16.

Example and a worksheet calculation:

Assume the following balance sheet amounts prior to deduction of these items:
* Common equity tier 1 capital subtotal amount reported in Schedule RC-R, item 12 = $100
* Significant investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial institutions net of associated DTLs = $15.
* MSAs net of associated DTLs = $7
* DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks net of any related valuation allowance and net of DTLs = $6
* Amounts of each item that exceed the 10% limit:
	* Significant investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial institutions net of associated DTLs = $5 (reported in Schedule RC-R, item 13)
	* MSAs net of associated DTLs = $0 (reported in Schedule RC-R, item 14)
	* DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks net of any related valuation allowances and net of DTLs = $0 (reported in Schedule RC-R, item 15).

Calculation steps:
(i) Sum of the significant investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial institutions, MSAs, and DTAs (all net of associated DTLs) before deductions: $15 + $7 + $6 = $28
(ii) 15% of the amount from Schedule RC-R, item 12: 15% x $100 = $15
(iii) Sum of the amounts reported in Schedule RC-R, items 13, 14, and 15: $5
(iv) Deduct the amount in step (iii) from the amount in step (i): $28 - $5 = $23 (This is the amount of these three items that remains after the 10% deductions are taken.)
(v) Deduct the amount in step (ii) from the amount in step (iv): $23 - $15 = $8 (This is an additional deduction that must be taken).
(vi) Determine the amount of the deduction for the applicable calendar year: $8 x 40% (amount that applies in calendar year 2015) = $3.20
Report $3.20 in this item 16.

B. Starting on January 1, 2018, calculate this item 16 as follows:

Example and a worksheet calculation:

Assumptions:
* The amount reported in Schedule RC-R, item 12 is $130. (This amount is common equity tier 1 after all deductions and adjustments, except for deduction of the threshold items).
* Assume that the associated DTLs are zero; also assume the following balance sheet amounts prior to deduction of these items:
	* Significant investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial institutions net of associated DTLs = $10.
	* MSAs net of associated DTLs = $20
	* DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks net of any related valuation allowances and net of DTLs = $30.

(1)
Aggregate amount of threshold items before deductions
Enter the sum of:
a. Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock, net of associated DTLs (Schedule RC-R, item 13, step 1);
$10
b. MSAs net of associated DTLs (Schedule RC-R, item 14, step 1); and

a. Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock net of associated DTLs (as reported in Schedule RC-R, item 13)
$0
b. MSAs net of associated DTLs (as reported in Schedule RC-R, item 14)

c. DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, net of related valuation allowances and net of DTLs (as reported in Schedule RC-R, item 15)
$30-$13=$17

(4)
Sum of threshold items not deducted as a result of the 10 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold
Enter the sum of:
a. Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock net of associated DTLs that are not deducted (that is, the difference between the amount in step (1)(a) of this table and step 3(a) of this table)
$10
b. MSAs that are not deducted (that is, the difference between the amount in step (1)(b) of this table and step 3(b) of this table)
$20 - $7 = $13
c. DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, net of related valuation allowances and net of DTLs that are not deducted (that is, the difference between the amount in step (1)(c) of this table and step (3)(c) of this table)
$30 - $17 = $13
d. Total of a, b, and c
$10+13 + $13 = $36

(5)
The 15 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold
Calculate as follows:
a. Subtract the amount calculated in step (1.d) of this table from Schedule RC-R, item 12;
b. Multiply the resulting amount by 17.65%
($130 - $60) x 17.65%=$12.36 Rounds to $12

(6)
Amount of threshold items that exceed the 15 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold
Report as follows:
a. If the amount in step (4.d) is greater than the amount in step (5), then subtract (5) from (4.d) and report this number in Schedule RC-R, item 16. (In addition, the institution must risk-weight the items that are not deducted at 250 percent in the risk-weighted asset section of this form.)
b. If the amount in step (4.d) is less than the amount in step (5) amount, report zero in Schedule RC-R, item 16.
The amount in step (4.d) ($36) is greater than the amount in step 3 ($12). Therefore: $36 - $12 = $24

(7)
Advanced approaches institutions only need to complete this calculation: if the amount in step (6) is above zero, then pro-rate the threshold items' deductions as follows:
a. Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock: multiply (6.a) by the ratio of (1.a) over (1.d).
a. $12 x (10/60)= $2
b. MSAs net of associated DTAs: multiply (6.a) by the ratio of (1.b) over (1.d).
b. $12 x (20/60)= $4
c. DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks: multiply (6.a) by the ratio of (1.c) over (1.d).
c. $12 x (30/60)= $6.</label>

Report the amount of non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock that, in the aggregate, exceed the 10 percent threshold for non-significant investments, calculated as described below. The institution may apply associated DTLs to this deduction.

Example and a worksheet calculation:

Assumptions:
* Assume that an institution has a total of $200 in non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, of which $100 is in common shares. For this example, all of the $100 in common shares is in the common stock of a publicly traded financial institution.
* Assume the amount reported on Schedule RC-R, item 5 (common equity tier 1 capital before adjustments and deductions (sum of items 1 through 4), is $1,000.
* Assume the amounts reported on Schedule RC-R, items 6 through 9.f, are all $0.

(1)
Determine the aggregate amount of non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (including in the form of common stock, additional tier 1, and tier 2 capital).
$200

(2)
Determine the amount of non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock.
$100

(3)
Subtract from Schedule RC-R, item 5, the amounts in Schedule RC-R, items 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
$1,000 - $0 = $1,000

(4)
Multiply the amount in step (3) by 10%. This is "the ten percent threshold for non-significant investments."
$1,000 x 10% = $100

(5)
If (1) is greater than (4), subtract (4) from (1) and multiply the result by the ratio of (2) divided by (1). Report this amount in this Schedule RC-R, item 11.
If (1) is less than (4), enter zero in this item 11.
Line (1) is greater than line (4); therefore $200 - $100 = $100. Then ($100 x 100/200) = $50 Report $50 in this item 11.

(6)
Assign the applicable risk weight to the amount of non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that does not exceed the ten percent threshold for non-significant investments.
Of the $100 in common shares, $50 are deducted in this item 11. The remaining $50 needs to be included in risk- weighted assets in Schedule RC-R, Part II.  In this case, $50 x 300% risk weight for publicly traded common shares = $150 in risk-weighted assets for the portion of common shares in an unconsolidated financial institution that are not deducted. Include this amount in Schedule RC-R, Part II, Risk-weighted Assets, in the "All other assets" item.

Transition provisions for investments in capital instruments:

(i) Calculate the amount as described in the instructions for this item 11.
(ii) Multiply the amount in (i) by the appropriate percent in Table 5 below. Report this product in this item 11.
(iii) Subtract (ii) from (i); assign it the applicable risk weight; and report it in Schedule RC-R, Part II, as part of risk-weighted assets.

(1) After-tax gain-on-sale in connection with a securitization exposure. Include any after-tax gain-on-sale in connection with a securitization exposure. Gain-on-sale means an increase in the equity capital of an institution resulting from a securitization (other than an increase in equity capital resulting from the institution's receipt of cash in connection with the securitization or reporting of a mortgage servicing asset on Schedule RC).

Transition provisions: Follow the transition provisions in Schedule RC-R, item 8.

(2) Defined benefit pension fund assets, net of associated DTLs. An institution that is not an insured depository institution should include any defined benefit pension fund asset, net of any associated DTLs.

Transition provisions: Follow the transition provisions in Schedule RC-R, item 8.

(3) Investments in the institution's own shares to the extent not excluded as part of treasury stock. Include the institution's investments in (including any contractual obligation to purchase) its own common stock instruments, including direct, indirect, and synthetic exposures to such capital instruments (as defined in the revised regulatory capital rules), to the extent such capital instruments are not excluded as part of treasury stock, reported in Schedule RC-R, item 1.

If an institution already deducts its investment in its own shares (for example, treasury stock) from its common equity tier 1 capital elements, it does not need to make such deduction twice.

An institution may deduct gross long positions net of short positions in the same underlying instrument only if the short positions involve no counterparty credit risk and all other criteria in section 22(h) of the revised regulatory capital rules are met.

The institution must look through any holdings of index securities to deduct investments
(cont.) in its own capital instruments. In addition:

(i) Gross long positions in investments in an institution's own regulatory capital instruments resulting from holdings of index securities may be netted against short positions in the same underlying index;
(ii) Short positions in index securities to hedge long cash or synthetic positions may be decomposed to recognize the hedge; and
(iii) The portion of the index composed of the same underlying exposure that is being hedged may be used to offset the long position only if both the exposure being hedged and the short position in the index are covered positions under the market risk rule, and the hedge is deemed effective by the institution's internal control processes.

Transition provisions: Follow the transition provisions in Schedule RC-R, item 11.

(4) Reciprocal cross-holdings in the capital of financial institutions in the form of common stock. Include investments in the capital of other financial institutions (in the form of common stock) that the institution holds reciprocally (this is the corresponding deduction approach). Such reciprocal crossholdings may result from a formal or informal arrangement to swap, exchange, or otherwise intend to hold each other's capital instruments.

Transition provisions: Follow the transition provisions in Schedule RC-R, item 11.

(5) Equity investments in financial subsidiaries. Include the aggregate amount of its outstanding equity investments, including retained earnings, in its financial subsidiaries (as defined in 12 CFR 5.39 (OCC); 12 CFR 208.77 (Board); and 12 CFR 362.17 (FDIC)). The assets and liabilities may not be consolidated with those of the parent institution. No other deduction is required for these investments in the capital instruments of financial subsidiaries.

(6) Advanced approaches institutions only that exit parallel run.  An advanced approaches institution that exits the parallel run is an advanced approaches institution that has completed the parallel run process and that has received notification from the primary federal supervisor pursuant to section 121(d) of subpart E of the revised regulatory capital rules.  Include the amount of expected credit loss that exceeds the institution's eligible credit reserves.

Exposure amount to be used for purposes of risk weighting
For an off-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan for which the bank calculates an exposure amount under section 37 of the regulatory capital rules, cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative), or over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contract (other than a credit derivative), the exposure amount is the notional amount of the exposure.

For an off-balance sheet securitization exposure to an asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) program, such as an eligible ABCP liquidity facility, the notional amount may be reduced to the maximum potential amount that the bank could be required to fund given the ABCP program's current underlying assets (calculated without regard to the current credit quality of those assets).  

The exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach (SSFA) does not apply is equal to the notional amount of the exposure multiplied by a credit conversion factor (CCF) of 50 percent.

The exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA applies is equal to the notional amount of the exposure multiplied by a CCF of 100 percent.

For an off-balance sheet securitization exposure that is a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan for which the bank calculates an exposure amount under section 37 of the regulatory capital rules, a cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative), or a derivative contract (other than a credit derivative), the exposure amount is the amount calculated under section 34, section 35, or section 37, as applicable, of the regulatory capital rules.

For a credit-enhancing representation and warranty that is an off-balance sheet securitization exposure, see the discussion of "Treatment of Sales of 1-4 Family Residential First Mortgage Loans with Credit-Enhancing Representations and Warranties," which includes an example, in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II.

Refer to the instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.b, for a summary of the reporting locations of AFS securitization exposures.

Exposure amount to be used for purposes of risk weighting - bank that cannot or has not made the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a:
For an AFS debt security that is a  securitization exposure where the bank cannot make or has not made the AOCI opt-out election (i.e., most AOCI is included in regulatory capital), the exposure amount of the AFS securitization exposure to be risk weighted by the bank is the carrying value of the debt security, which is the value of the asset reported on the balance sheet of the bank (Schedule RC, item 2.b) determined in accordance with GAAP (i.e., the fair value of the AFS debt security) and in column A of this item.

Exposure amount to be used for purposes of risk weighting - bank has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a:
For an AFS debt security that is a securitization exposure where the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election (i.e., most AOCI is not included in regulatory capital), the exposure amount of the AFS securitization exposure to be risk weighted by the bank is the carrying value of the debt security, less any unrealized gain on the exposure plus any unrealized loss on the exposure included in AOCI.

* In column B:
   * If an AFS securitization exposure will be risk weighted using the 1,250 percent risk weight approach, a bank that has made the AOCI opt-out election should include the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of those AFS debt securities that qualify as securitization exposures.  This difference equals the amounts reported in Schedule RC-B, items 4 and 5, column D, minus items 4 and 5, column C, for those AFS debt securities included in these items that are securitization exposures.  When fair value exceeds cost, report the difference as a positive number in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.b, column B.  When cost exceeds fair value, report the difference as a negative number (i.e., with a minus (-) sign) in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.b, column B.  
   * If an AFS securitization exposure will be risk weighted using either the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach (SSFA) or the Gross-Up Approach, a bank should report the carrying value of the AFS securitization exposure reported in column A of this item.

* In column Q, report the exposure amount of those AFS securitization exposures that are assigned a 1,250 percent risk weight (i.e., those AFS securitization exposures for which the risk-weighted asset amount is not calculated using the SSFA or the Gross-Up Approach).

* In column T, report the risk-weighted asset amount (not the exposure amount) of those AFS securitization exposures for which the risk-weighted asset amount is calculated using the SSFA, as described above in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II and in section 41 to section 45 of the regulatory capital rules.

* In column U, report the risk-weighted asset amount (not the exposure amount) of those AFS securitization exposures for which the risk-weighted asset amount is calculated using the Gross-Up Approach, as described above in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II, and in section 41 to section 45 of the regulatory capital rules.

Example 1: A bank reports an AFS securitization exposure on its balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 2.b, at a carrying value (i.e., fair value) of $105. The amortized cost of the AFS securitization exposure is $100.  The AFS securitization exposure has a $5 unrealized gain that is included in AOCI.  The bank has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC R, Part I, item 3.a.  The AFS securitization exposure will be risk weighted using the 1,250 percent risk weight approach. The bank would report in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.b:
* $105 in column A.  This is the carrying value of the AFS securitization exposure on the bank's balance sheet.
* $5 in column B.  This is the difference between the carrying value (i.e., fair value) of the AFS securitization exposure and its exposure amount that is subject to risk weighting. For a bank that has made the AOCI opt-out election, column B will typically represent the amount of the unrealized gain or unrealized loss on securitization exposure. Gains are reported as positive numbers; losses as negative numbers. (Note: If the bank has not made or cannot make the opt-out election, there will not be an adjustment to be reported in column B.)
* $100 is the exposure amount subject to risk weighting.  This amount will be reported in item 9.b, column Q--1,250% risk weight.  For a bank that has made the AOCI opt-out election, the exposure amount typically will be the carrying value (i.e., fair value) of the AFS securitization exposure excluding any unrealized gain or loss. 

Example 2: A bank reports an AFS securitization exposure on its balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 2.b, at a carrying value (i.e., fair value) of $105.  The AFS securitization exposure has a $5 unrealized gain that is included in AOCI.  The bank has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a.  The AFS securitization exposure will be risk weighted using the Gross-Up Approach and it is assigned a 900 percent risk weight using this approach.  The bank would report in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.b:

* $105 in column B.  When the Gross-Up Approach is being used, the carrying amount of the AFS securitization exposure on the bank's balance sheet is to be reported in column B.  Because the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election, the $105 carrying amount consists of two components: (i) $100 is the exposure amount subject to risk-weighting at 900 percent, and (ii) $5 is difference between the carrying value and the exposure amount that is subject to risk weighting. 
* $900 in column U.  This is the risk-weighted asset amount of the AFS securitization exposure. This amount ($900) will be reported in item 9.b, column U-Gross-Up.  (Note:  $900 is the product of the $100 exposure amount multiplied by a 900 percent risk weight.)</label>

Examples:  Reporting Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase (Repos) under the Simple Approach for Recognizing the Effects of Collateral

Section	37 of the regulatory capital rules provides for the recognition of the risk-mitigating effects of collateral when risk weighting assets collateralized by financial collateral (which is defined in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules).  The following examples illustrate the calculation of risk-weighted assets and the reporting of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repos) in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 16, using the Simple Approach.

Example 1:  Security sold under an agreement to repurchase fully collateralized by cash
A bank has transferred an available-for-sale (AFS) debt security to a counterparty in a repo transaction that is accounted for as a secured borrowing on the bank's balance sheet.  The bank received $100 in cash from the repo counterparty in this transaction.  The amortized cost and the fair value of the AFS debt security are both $100 as of the report date.[21]  The debt security is an exposure to a U.S. government-sponsored entity (GSE) that qualifies for a 20 percent risk weight.  The repo counterparty is a company that would receive a 100 percent risk weight.
  
Calculation of risk-weighted assets for the transaction:

1. The bank continues to report the AFS GSE debt security as an asset on its balance sheet and to risk weight the security as an on-balance sheet asset at 20 percent:[22]
$100 x 20% = $20  
2. The bank has a $100 exposure to the repo counterparty (the report date fair value of the security transferred to the counterparty) that is collateralized by the $100 of cash received from the counterparty.  The bank risk weights its exposure to the repo counterparty at zero percent in recognition of the cash received in the transaction from the counterparty:  $100 x 0% = $0

3. There is no additional exposure to the repo counterparty to risk weight because the exposure to the counterparty is fully collateralized by the cash received.
The total risk-weighted assets arising from the transaction:  $20

The bank would report the transaction in Schedule RC-R, Part II, as follows:

1. The bank reports the AFS debt security in item 2.b:
	a. The $100 carrying value (i.e., the fair value) of the AFS debt security on the balance sheet will be reported in column A.[23]
	b. The $100 exposure amount of the AFS debt security will be reported in column G-20% risk weight (which is the applicable risk weight for a U.S. GSE debt security).

2. The bank reports the repurchase agreement in item 16:
	a. The bank's $100 exposure to the repo counterparty, which is the fair value of the debt security transferred in the repo transaction, is the exposure amount to be reported in column A.
	b. The $100 credit equivalent amount of the bank's exposure to the repo counterparty will be reported in column B. 
	c. Because the bank's exposure to the repo counterparty is fully collateralized by the $100 of cash received from the counterparty, the $100 credit equivalent amount of the repurchase agreement will be reported in column C-0% risk weight (which is the applicable risk weight for cash collateral).

Example 2:  Security sold under an agreement to repurchase (repo) not fully collateralized by cash  
A bank has transferred an AFS debt security to a counterparty in a repo transaction that is accounted for as a secured borrowing on the bank's balance sheet.  The bank received $98 in cash from the repo counterparty in this transaction.  The amortized cost and the fair value of the AFS debt security are both $100 as of the report date.[24]  The debt security is an exposure to a U.S. GSE that qualifies for a 20 percent risk weight.  The repo counterparty is a company that would receive a 100 percent risk weight.    

Calculation of risk-weighted assets for the transaction:

1. The bank continues to report the AFS GSE debt security as an asset on its balance sheet and to risk weight the security as an on-balance sheet asset at 20 percent:[25]
$100 x 20% = $20  
2. The bank has a $100 exposure to the repo counterparty (the report date fair value of the security transferred to the counterparty) of which $98 is collateralized by the cash received from the counterparty.  The bank risk weights the portion of its exposure to the repo counterparty that is collateralized by the cash received from the counterparty at zero percent:  $98 x 0% = $0
3. The bank risk weights its $2 uncollateralized exposure to the repo counterparty using the risk weight applicable to the counterparty:  $2 x 100% = $2
The total risk-weighted assets arising from the transaction:  $22

The bank would report the transaction in Schedule RC-R, Part II, as follows:

1. The bank reports the AFS debt security in item 2.b:
	a. The $100 carrying value (i.e., the fair value) of the AFS debt security on the balance sheet will be reported in column A.   
	b. The $100 exposure amount of the AFS debt security will be reported in column G-20% risk weight (which is the applicable risk weight for a U.S. GSE debt security).

2. The bank reports the repurchase agreement in item 16:
	a. The bank's $100 exposure to the repo counterparty, which is the fair value of the debt security transferred in the repo transaction, is the exposure amount to be reported in column A.
	b. The $100 credit equivalent amount of the bank's exposure to the repo counterparty will be reported in column B. 
	c. Because the bank's exposure to the repo counterparty is collateralized by the $98 of cash received from the counterparty, $98 of the $100 credit equivalent amount of the repurchase agreement will be reported in column C-0% risk weight (which is the applicable risk weight for cash collateral). 
	d. The $2 uncollateralized exposure to the repo counterparty will be reported in column I-100% risk weight (which is the applicable risk weight for the repo counterparty).

[19]  Although securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reported on the balance sheet (Schedule RC) as assets and liabilities, respectively, they are included with securities lent and securities borrowed and designated as repo-style transactions that are treated collectively as off-balance sheet items under the regulatory capital rules.   

[20]  For held-to-maturity securities that have been lent, the amortized cost of these securities is reported in Schedule RC-L, item 6.a, but the fair value of these securities should be reported as the exposure amount in column A of this item.

[21]  In both Example 1 and Example 2, because the fair value carrying value of the AFS GSE debt security equals the amortized cost of the debt security, a bank that has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a, does not need to adjust the carrying value (i.e., the fair value) of the debt security to determine the exposure amount of the security.  Thus, for a bank that has made the AOCI opt-out election, the carrying value of the AFS debt security equals its exposure amount in Examples 1 and 2.

Also exclude small business obligations transferred with recourse under Section 208 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, which are to be reported in Schedule RC-S, Memorandum item 1, below.  

Do not report in this item the outstanding balance of 1-4 family residential mortgages sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) that the government-sponsored agency in turn securitizes.  Report 1-4 family residential mortgages sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac with recourse or other seller-provided credit enhancements in Schedule RC-S, item 11, column A, and report the maximum credit exposure arising from the enhancements in item 12, column A.  If servicing has been retained on the 1-4 family residential mortgages, report the outstanding principal balance of the mortgages in Schedule RC-S, Memorandum item 2.a or 2.b depending on whether the servicing is performed with or without recourse or other servicer-provided credit enhancements.  If the bank has both retained the servicing and provided credit enhancements, report the principal balance of the 1-4 family residential mortgages in Schedule RC-S, item 11, column A, and in Memorandum item 2.a.

Exclude securitizations that the reporting bank has accounted for as secured borrowings because the transactions do not meet the criteria for sale accounting under generally accepted accounting principles.  The securitized loans, leases, and other assets should continue to be carried as assets on the reporting bank's balance sheet.</label>

Safekeeping and custody accounts are a type of agency account in which the reporting institution performs one or more specified agency functions but the institution is not a trustee and also is not responsible for managing the asset selection for account assets. These agency services may include holding assets, processing income and redemptions, and other recordkeeping and customer reporting services. For employee benefit custody or safekeeping accounts, the number of accounts reported should reflect the total number of plans administered rather than the number of plan participants. Include accounts in which the institution serves in a sub-custodian capacity. For example, where one institution contracts with another for custody services, both institutions should report the accounts in their respective capacity. Individual Retirement Accounts, Health Savings Accounts, and other similar accounts should also be reported in Schedule RC-T, item 13.

Accounts in which the institution serves as trustee or in an agency capacity in addition to being custodian should be reported in the category of the primary relationship. For example, personal trust accounts in which the institution also serves as custodian should be reported as personal trust accounts and not as custodian accounts. An institution should report an account only once in Schedule RC-T, items 4 through 9 and 11.

Report custodian accounts that are incidental to fiduciary services. Include those custody and safekeeping accounts that are administered by the trust department, and those that are administered in other areas of the institution through an identifiable business unit that focuses on offering fiduciary related custodial services to institutional clients. Exclude those custodial and escrow activities related to commercial bank services such as hold-in-custody repurchase assets, securities safekeeping services for correspondent banks, escrow assets held for the benefit of third parties, safety deposit box assets, and any other similar commercial arrangement.</label>

Tax-exempt securities, loans, and leases are those securities, loans, and leases of states and political subdivisions in the U.S. whose interest is excludable from gross income under the regular tax system for federal income tax purposes, regardless of whether the income must be included in the bank's alternative minimum taxable income.

Exclude from this item interest expense incurred to carry (1) tax-exempt securities, loans, and leases of states and political subdivisions in the U.S. acquired after December 31, 1982, but before August 8, 1986, and (2) so-called "Qualified tax-exempt obligations" acquired after August 7, 1986, 20 percent of which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes.

The general formula that may be used for computing the amount of interest expense that is subject to a 100 percent loss of deductibility is as follows:

	Tax-exempt securities, loans, and leases of
	states and political subdivisions in the U.S.
	acquired after August 7, 1986 (excluding		Year-to-Date	
	"Qualified tax-exempt obligations")		total interest

Include in this item:

(1) Income earned in connection with mutual funds and annuities that are sold on bank premises or are otherwise sold by the reporting bank, through a bank subsidiary, or by affiliated or unaffiliated entities from whom the bank receives income.  This income may be in the form of fees or sales commissions at the time of the sale or fees, including a share of another entity's fees, that are earned over the duration of the account (e.g., annual fees, Rule 12b-1 fees or "trailer fees," and redemption fees).  Commissions should be reported as income as earned at the time of the sale (i.e., on an accrual basis), but may be reported as income when payment is received if the results would not differ materially from those obtained using an accrual basis.

(2) Income from leasing arrangements with affiliated and unaffiliated entities who lease space in bank offices for use in selling mutual funds and annuities.  Income from leasing arrangements should be reported as income as earned (i.e., on an accrual basis), but may be reported as income when payment is received if the results would not differ materially from those obtained using an accrual basis.

(3) Fees for providing investment advisory services for proprietary mutual funds and annuities.

(4) Fees for providing securities custody, transfer agent, and other operational and ancillary services to mutual funds and annuities that are sold on bank premises or are otherwise sold by the reporting bank, through a bank subsidiary, or by affiliated or unaffiliated entities from whom the bank receives income at the time of the sale or over the duration of the account.

Also include income from sales conducted through the reporting bank's trust department that are not executed in a fiduciary capacity (e.g., trustee, executor, administrator, conservator), but exclude income from sales conducted by the trust department that are executed in a fiduciary capacity.

In general, this income will have been included in Schedule RI, item 5.d.(1), "Fees and commissions from securities brokerage" (for mutual funds) and item 5.d.(3), "Fees and commissions from annuity sales."  However, income from leasing arrangements, or the portion thereof, that is fixed in amount and does not vary based on sales volume may have been reported as a deduction from Schedule RI, item 7.b, "Expenses of premises and fixed assets."  Thus, the income to be included in this item should be reported gross rather than net of expenses incurred by the reporting bank or a consolidated subsidiary.

Exclude fees earned for providing securities custody, transfer agent, and other operational and ancillary services to third party mutual funds and annuities that are not sold on bank premises and are not otherwise sold by the reporting bank, through a bank subsidiary, or by affiliated or unaffiliated entities from whom the bank receives income at the time of the sale or over the duration of the account.</label>

For example, a bank that was acquired as of the close of business June 1, 2005, and applied push down accounting to its balance sheet would report 20050601 in this Memorandum item in the Reports of Condition and Income for June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2005. 

Push down accounting is the establishment of a new accounting basis for a bank in its separate financial statements (including its Reports of Condition and Income) as a result of the bank becoming substantially wholly owned by an investor (which may be a holding company) or a group of investors working collaboratively via a purchase transaction or a series of purchase transactions.  When push down accounting is used to account for the acquisition of a bank that becomes substantially wholly owned, yet retains its separate corporate existence, the bank's assets and liabilities (Schedule RC) are restated based on the amount or amounts paid to purchase the bank's voting stock.  The purchase cost should be allocated to the bank's assets and liabilities based on their fair values as of the date(s) of the purchase transaction(s).  In the year the bank applies push down accounting, its income statements (Schedule RI) for periods after the date it became substantially wholly owned should only include amounts from that date through the end of the calendar year-to-date reporting period.  

If the reporting bank has not been acquired during this calendar year or if the reporting bank has been acquired during this calendar year but push down accounting was not applied, the bank should report zeros (i.e., 00000000) in the year, month, and day columns of this Memorandum item.</label>

(2)  Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs, and purchase premiums and discounts on loans held for investment, all of which should be deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield under FASB Statement No. 91 as described in the Glossary entry for "loan fees."

To determine whether the impairment is other-than-temporary, a bank must apply the relevant guidance in ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities (formerly FASB Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," as amended by FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments," and FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, "Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments") and ASC Subtopic 325-40, Investments-Other - Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets (formerly Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99-20, "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets," as amended by FSP EITF 99-20-1, "Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20"), as appropriate.

Report in the appropriate subitem the specified information on other-than-temporary impairment losses on held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt securities that have occurred during the calendar year to date.  The amounts to be reported in Memorandum item 14 should be determined as of the date each other-than-temporary impairment loss is initially recognized on an individual debt security during the current calendar year, i.e., based on the fair value and amortized cost of the other-than-temporarily impaired debt security as of that measurement date, and these amounts should be adjusted only to reflect any additional impairment loss on the debt security that is recognized in earnings during the same calendar year.  The amounts reported in Memorandum items 14.a and 14.b should not be adjusted to reflect any recoveries in the fair value of the other-than-temporarily impaired debt security that occur after the date when the other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) loss was initially recognized in earnings during the current calendar year.  In contrast, the amounts reported in Memorandum items 14.a, 14.b, and 14.c should be adjusted to reflect a further decline in the fair value of the other-than-temporarily impaired debt security during the current calendar year that is accompanied by an additional impairment loss on the debt security that increases the previously reported impairment loss recognized in earnings during the current calendar year.[1]
  
Consider the following examples: [2]

Example 1:

	First Quarter 2013:
	*Debt security with a $1,000 amortized cost basis and fair value of $900.
	*Impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary.
	*Total OTTI loss of $100 is comprised of a $10 credit loss recognized in earnings and a $90 loss related to factors other than credit recognized in other comprehensive income.
	*The new amortized cost basis of the debt security after the recognition of the credit loss is $990.

	Second Quarter 2013:
	*Debt security has increased in fair value to $920.
	*The credit loss has increased by $20, which is recognized in earnings.
	*This additional other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized in earnings results in a new amortized cost basis of $970 for the debt security.

	Third Quarter 2013:
	*Debt security has increased in fair value to $950
	*The credit loss is unchanged from the second quarter of 2013, so the amortized cost basis remains $970.

	The events listed above would be reported in Memorandum items 14.a, 14.b, and 14.c, as follows:


	March 31, 2013	June 30, 2013	September 30, 2013
14.a	$100	                $100	                $100
14.b	90	                70	                70
14.c	$10	                $30	                $30
			

[1]  This reporting treatment should be applied to other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized on or after January 1, 2013.
[2 ] In these examples, references to the amortized cost of the debt security in periods after the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment loss ignore the effect of the accretion of the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected.
 
Note that Memorandum items 14.b and 14.c are adjusted as of June 30, 2013, to reflect the increase in the other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized in earnings (the increased credit loss) that occurred in the second quarter of 2013; however, Memorandum items 14.a and 14.b are not adjusted as of June 30 and September 30, 2013, to reflect the increases in the fair value of the debt security that occurred in the second and third quarters of 2013 because these recoveries in fair value do not result in a reduction in the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment loss initially recognized in earnings in the first quarter of 2013.

Example 2:

	First Quarter 2013:
	*Same facts as in Example 1.

	Second Quarter 2013:
	*Debt security has declined in fair value to $870.
	*The credit loss has increased by $20, which is recognized in earnings.
	*This additional other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized in earnings results in a new amortized cost basis of $970 for the debt security.

	Third Quarter 2013:
	*Debt security has increased in fair value to $920
	*The credit loss is unchanged from the second quarter of 2013, so the amortized cost basis remains $970.

	The events listed above would be reported in Memorandum items 14.a, 14.b, and 14.c, as follows:

	Note that Memorandum items 14.a, 14.b, and 14.c are adjusted as of June 30, 2013, to reflect the additional decline in fair value of the other-than-temporarily impaired debt security that accompanied the increase in the other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized in earnings (the increased credit loss) in the second quarter of 2013; however, Memorandum items 14.a and 14.b are not adjusted as of September 30, 2013, to reflect the increase in the fair value of the debt security that occurred in the third quarter of 2013 because this recovery in fair value did not result in a reduction in the amount of other-than-temporary impairment losses initially and subsequently recognized in earnings in the first and second quarters, respectively, of 2013.

Disclose in Schedule RI-E, items 2.a through 2.p, each component of other noninterest expense, and the dollar amount of such component, that is greater than $100,000 and exceeds 3 percent of the other noninterest expense reported in this item. If net gains have been reported in this item for a component of "Other noninterest expense," use the absolute value of such net gains to determine whether the amount of the net gains is greater than $100,000 and exceeds 3 percent of "Other noninterest expense" and should be reported in Schedule RI-E, item 2. (The absolute value refers to the magnitude of the dollar amount without regard to whether the amount represents net gains or net losses.)

Preprinted captions have been provided in Schedule RI-E, items 2.a through 2.m, for reporting the following components of other noninterest expense if the component exceeds this disclosure threshold: data processing expenses; advertising and marketing expenses; directors' fees; printing, stationery, and supplies; postage; legal fees and expenses; FDIC deposit insurance assessments; accounting and auditing expenses; consulting and advisory expenses; automated teller machine (ATM) and interchange expenses; telecommunications expenses; other real estate owned expenses; and insurance expenses (not included in salaries and employee benefits, expenses of premises and fixed assets, and other real estate owned expenses). For each component of other noninterest expense that exceeds this disclosure threshold for which a preprinted caption has not been provided, describe the component with a clear but concise caption in Schedule RI-E, items 2.n through 2.p. These descriptions should not exceed 50 characters in length (including spacing between words).

For disclosure purposes in Schedule RI-E, items 2.a through 2.m, when components of "Other noninterest expense" reflect a single charge for separate "bundled services" provided by third party vendors, disclose such amounts in the item with the preprinted caption that most closely describes the predominant type of expense incurred, and this categorization should be used consistently over time.

Include as other noninterest expense:

(1) Fees paid to directors and advisory directors for attendance at board of directors' or committee meetings (including travel and expense allowances).

(2) Cost of data processing services performed for the bank by others.

(3) Advertising, promotional, public relations, marketing, and business development expenses. Such expenses include the cost of athletic activities in which officers and employees participate when the purpose may be construed to be for marketing or public relations, and employee benefits are only incidental to the activities.

(6) Cost of printing, stationery, and office supplies.

(9) Federal deposit insurance assessments and Financing Corporation (FICO) assessments.

(10) Premiums on fidelity insurance (blanket bond, excess employee dishonesty bond), directors' and officers' liability insurance, and life insurance policies for which the bank is the beneficiary.

(11) Assessment expense, examination expense, and other fees levied by the Comptroller of the Currency or a state chartering authority, net of any assessment credits during the period.

(12) Legal fees and other direct costs incurred to effect foreclosures on real estate and subsequent noninterest expenses related to holdings of real estate owned other than bank premises (including depreciation charges, if appropriate).

(13) Net losses (gains) from the sale or other disposal of branches (i.e., where the reporting bank sells a branch's assets to another depository institution, which assumes the deposit liabilities of the branch). Banks should consistently report these net losses (gains) either in this item or in Schedule RI, item 5.l.

(14) Net losses (gains) from all transactions involving foreign currency or foreign exchange other than trading transactions. Banks should consistently report these net losses (gains) either in this item or in Schedule RI, item 5.l.

(15) Management fees assessed by the bank's parent holding company, whether for specific services rendered or of a general (prorated) nature.

(16) Sales taxes, taxes based on the number of shares of bank stock outstanding, taxes based on the bank's total assets or total deposits, taxes based on the bank's gross revenues or gross receipts, capital stock taxes, and other taxes not included in other categories of expense. Exclude any foreign, state, and local taxes based on a net amount of revenues less expenses (report as applicable income taxes in Schedule RI, items 9).

(17) Fees levied by deposit brokers that are, in substance, retainer fees or that otherwise do not represent an adjustment to the interest rate paid on deposits the reporting bank acquires through brokers. However, report as interest expense on the appropriate category of deposits those finders' fees and brokers' fees that do represent an adjustment to the interest rate paid on brokered deposits.

(18) Research and development costs and costs incurred in the internal development of computer software.

(19) Charges resulting from litigation or other claims.

(20) Charitable contributions including donations by Clifford Trusts.

(21) Fees for accounting, auditing, and attestation services; retainer fees; and other fees and expenses paid to accountants and auditors who are not bank officers or employees.

(22) Fees for consulting and advisory services, retainer fees, and other fees and expenses paid to management consultants, investment advisors, and other professionals (other than attorneys providing legal services and accountants providing accounting, auditing, and attestation services) who are not bank officers or employees.

(23) Net losses (gains) on derivative instruments held for purposes other than trading that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedging relationships that qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"). Institutions should consistently report these net losses (gains) either in this item or in Schedule RI, item 5.l. For further information, see the Glossary entries for "derivative contracts" and "trading account."

(24) Net tellers' shortages (overages), net losses (recoveries) on forged checks, net losses (recoveries) on payment of checks over stop payment orders, and similar recurring operating losses (gains) of this type. Banks should consistently report these losses (gains) either in this item or in Schedule RI, item 5.l.

(25) Net losses resulting from fiduciary and related services. Net losses are gross losses less recoveries (including those from insurance payments). Gross losses include settlements, surcharges, and other losses arising from errors, misfeasance, or malfeasance on fiduciary accounts and related services and should reflect losses recognized on an accrual basis. Recoveries may be for current or prior years' losses from fiduciary and related services and should be reported when payment is actually realized. If the institution enters into a "fee reduction" or "fee waiver" agreement with a client as the method for reimbursing or compensating the client for a loss on the client's fiduciary or related services account, the full amount of this loss must be recognized on an accrual basis and reported in this item as "Other noninterest expense." An institution should not report such a loss as a reduction of the gross income from fiduciary and related services it reports in Schedule RI, item 5.a, "Income from fiduciary activities," in the current or future periods when the "fee reduction" or "fee waiver" takes place.  (See the example after the instructions to Schedule RC-T, Memorandum item 4.e.)  For institutions required to complete Schedule RC-T, item 24, the amount of net losses from fiduciary and related services also is reported in that item.

(26) Losses from robberies, defalcations, and other criminal acts not covered by the bank's blanket bond.

(27) Travel and entertainment expenses, including costs incurred by bank officers and employees for attending meetings and conventions.

(29) Civil money penalties and fines.

(30) All service charges, commissions, and fees levied by others for the repossession of assets and the collection of the bank's loans or other assets, including charged-off loans
or other charged-off assets.

(31) Expenses (except salaries) related to handling credit card or charge sales received from merchants when the bank does not carry the related loan accounts on its books. Banks are also permitted to net these expenses against their charges to merchants for the bank's handling of these sales in Schedule RI, item 5.l.

(32) Expenses related to the testing and training of officers and employees.

(33) The cost of bank newspapers and magazines prepared for distribution to bank officers and employees or to others.

(34) Depreciation expense of furniture and equipment rented to others under operating leases.

(35) Cost of checks provided to depositors.

(36) Amortization expense of purchased computer software and of the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed capitalized in accordance with the provisions of ASC Subtopic 985-20, Software - Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased or Marketed (formerly FASB Statement No. 86, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed").

(37) Provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures.

(38) Net losses (gains) from the extinguishment of liabilities (debt), including losses resulting from the payment of prepayment penalties on borrowings such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances. However, if a bank's debt extinguishments normally result in net gains over time, then the bank should consistently report its net gains (losses) in Schedule RI, item 5.l, "Other noninterest income."
 
(39) Automated teller machine (ATM) and interchange expenses from bank card and credit card transactions.

Exclude from other noninterest expense:

(1) Material expenses incurred in the issuance of subordinated notes and debentures (capitalize such expenses and amortize them over the life of the related notes and debentures and report the expense in Schedule RI, item 2.d, "Interest on subordinated notes and debentures").

(2) Expenses incurred in the sale of preferred and common stock (deduct such expenses from the sale proceeds and credit the net amount to the appropriate stock account.  For perpetual preferred and common stock only, report the net sales proceeds in Schedule RI-A, item 5, "Sale, conversion, acquisition, or retirement of capital stock, net").

(3) Depreciation and other expenses related to the use of bank-owned automobiles, airplanes, and other vehicles for bank business (report in Schedule RI, item 7.b, "Expenses of premises and fixed assets").

(4) Write-downs of the cost basis of individual held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities for other than temporary impairments (report in Schedule RI, item 6.a, "Realized gains (losses) on held-to-maturity securities," and item 6.b, "Realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities," respectively).

(5) Revaluation adjustments to the carrying value of all assets and liabilities reported in Schedule RC at fair value under a fair value option. Banks should report these net decreases (increases) in fair value on trading assets and liabilities in Schedule RI, item 5.c; on servicing assets and liabilities in Schedule RI, item 5.f; and on other financial assets and liabilities in Schedule RI, item 5.l. Interest income earned and interest expense incurred on these financial assets and liabilities should be excluded from the net decreases (increases) in fair value and reported in the appropriate interest income or interest expense items on Schedule RI.</label>

Negative amortization refers to a method in which a loan is structured so that the borrower's minimum monthly (or other periodic) payment is contractually permitted to be less than the full amount of interest owed to the lender, with the unpaid interest added to the loan's principal balance.  The contractual terms of the loan provide that if the borrower allows the principal balance to rise to a pre-specified amount or maximum cap, the loan payments are then recast to a fully amortizing schedule.  Negative amortization features may be applied to either adjustable rate mortgages or fixed rate mortgages, the latter commonly referred to as graduated payment mortgages (GPMs).

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-line-772846_lbl_1841" xml:lang="en">Memorandum items 15.a through 15.d are to be completed by institutions with $1 billion or more in total assets[1] that answered "Yes" to Schedule RC-E, (Part I,) Memorandum item 5, "Does your institution offer one or more consumer deposit account products, i.e., transaction account or nontransaction savings account deposit products intended primarily for individuals for personal, household, or family use?"  Such institutions should report in the appropriate subitem the year-to-date amount of the specified category of service charges on deposit accounts included in Schedule RI, item 5.b, "Service charges on deposit accounts (in domestic offices)." Consistent with the instructions for Schedule RI, item 5.b, the amount of service charges on deposit accounts reported in Memorandum items 15.a through 15.d should be net of amounts refunded to depositors.

The specified categories of service charges to be reported in Schedule RI, Memorandum items 15.a through 15.c, are those levied against consumer deposit account products offered by the reporting institution during the calendar year to date that would be reportable in Schedule RC-E, Memorandum items 6.a, 6.b, 7.a.(1), and 7.b.(1).

Once a customer has opened a deposit account with the reporting institution that is a deposit product intended primarily for individuals for personal, household, or family use, the institution is not required thereafter to review the customer's status or usage of the account to determine whether the transaction account is being used for personal, household, or family purposes.  Thus, when reporting the amount of service charges on consumer deposit account products in Schedule RI, Memorandum items 15.a through 15.c, below, the reporting institution is not required to identify those individual accounts within the population of a particular consumer deposit account product that are not being used for personal, household, or family purposes and remove any service charges levied against these accounts from the total amounts of overdraft-related, periodic maintenance, and customer automated teller machine (ATM) fees charged to customer accounts within that consumer deposit product.

Treatment of Transfer Fees - If the reporting institution levies a service charge or fee on a consumer deposit account for a transfer between the account holder's deposit account and another account (including a loan account) regardless of the means by which the transfer is effected (e.g., in person, by telephone, via an ATM, and via online account access), the transfer fee should be reported in Schedule RI, Memorandum item 15.d, "All other service charges on deposit accounts."  In contrast, if the reporting institution levies a service charge or fee on a consumer deposit account for the account holder's use of an ATM to effect a transfer between the account holder's deposit account and another account (and not for the transfer itself), the service charge or fee is considered a fee for accessing the ATM and should be reported in Schedule RI, Memorandum item 15.c, "Consumer customer automated teller machine (ATM) fees levied on those transaction account and nontransaction savings account deposit products intended primarily for individuals for personal, household, or family use," and is not considered a transfer fee.

The sum of Memorandum items 15.a through 15.d must equal Schedule RI, item 5.b.


[1]  In general, the determination as to whether an institution has $1 billion or more in total assets is measured as of June 30 of the previous calendar year. See pages 3 and 4 of the General Instructions for guidance on shifts in reporting status.</label>

The amount of those HTM securities reported in Schedule RC, item 2.a, that qualify as securitization exposures are to be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.a, column A.  The sum of Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 2.a and 9.a, column A, must equal Schedule RC, item 2.a. 

Exposure amount to be used for purposes of risk weighting - bank cannot or has not made the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a:
For a security classified as HTM where the bank cannot or has not made the AOCI opt-out election (i.e., most AOCI is included in regulatory capital), the exposure amount to be risk weighted by the bank is the carrying value of the security, which is the value of the asset reported (a) on the balance sheet of the bank determined in accordance with GAAP and (b) in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.a, column A.

Exposure amount to be used for purposes of risk weighting - bank has made the AOCI opt out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a:
For a security classified as HTM where the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election (i.e., most AOCI is not included in regulatory capital), the exposure amount to be risk weighted by the bank is the carrying value of the security reported (a) on the balance sheet of the bank and (b) in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.a, column A, less any net unrealized gain on the exposure plus any net unrealized loss on the exposure included in AOCI.  For purposes of determining the exposure amount of an HTM security, an unrealized gain (loss), if any, on such a security that is included in AOCI is (i) the unamortized balance of the unrealized gain (loss) that existed at the date of transfer of a debt security transferred into the held to maturity category from the available for sale category, or (ii) the unaccreted portion of other-than-temporary impairment losses on an HTM debt security that was not recognized in earnings in accordance with ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities (formerly FASB Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities").

   * The portion of any exposure reported in Schedule RC, item 2.a, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 100 percent risk weight.
   * Also include all other HTM securities that do not qualify as securitization exposures reported in Schedule RC, item 2.a, that are not included in columns C through H and J.

Exposure amounts to be used for purposes of risk weighting by a bank that cannot or has not made the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a:
For a security classified as AFS where the bank cannot or has not made the AOCI opt-out election (i.e., most AOCI is included in regulatory capital), the exposure amount to be risk weighted by the bank is:	
* For debt securities: the carrying value, which is the value of the asset reported on the balance sheet of the bank determined in accordance with GAAP (i.e., the fair value of the AFS debt security) and in column A.
* For equity securities and preferred stock classified as an equity under GAAP: the adjusted carrying value.[13]  

Exposure amounts to be used for purposes of risk weighting by a bank that has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a:
For a security classified as AFS where the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election (i.e., most AOCI is not included in regulatory capital), the exposure amount to be risk weighted by the bank is:
* For debt securities: the carrying value, less any net unrealized gains on the exposure plus any net realized loss on the exposure included in AOCI.
* For equity securities and preferred stock classified as an equity under GAAP: the carrying value less any net unrealized gains that are reflected in such carrying value but are excluded from the bank's regulatory capital components.

* In column B, a bank that has made the AOCI opt-out election should include the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of those AFS debt securities that do not qualify as securitization exposures.  This difference equals the amounts reported in Schedule RC-B, items 1 through 6, column D, minus items 1 through 6, column C, for those AFS debt securities included in these items that are not securitization exposures. 
   * When fair value exceeds cost, report the difference as a positive number in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.b, column B. 
   * When cost exceeds fair value, report the difference as a negative number (i.e., with a minus (-) sign) in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.b, column B. 
   * If AFS equity securities with readily determinable fair values have a net unrealized gain (i.e., Schedule RC-B, item 7, column D, exceeds item 7, column C), the portion of the net unrealized gain (55 percent or more) not included in Tier 2 capital should be included in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.b, column B.  The portion that is not included in Tier 2 capital equals Schedule RC-B, item 7, column D minus column C, minus Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 31.

Example: A bank reports an AFS debt security that is not a securitization exposure on its balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 2.b, at a carrying value (i.e., fair value) of $105.  The amortized cost of the debt security is $100.  The bank has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a.  The AFS debt security has a $5 unrealized gain that is included in AOCI. In Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.b, the bank would report in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.b:
a. $105 in column A.  This is the carrying value of the AFS debt security on the bank's balance sheet.
b. $5 in column B.  This is the difference between the carrying value (i.e., fair value) of the debt security and its exposure amount that is subject to risk weighting. For a bank that has made the AOCI opt-out election, column B will typically represent the amount of the unrealized gain or unrealized loss on the security. Gains are reported as positive numbers; losses as negative numbers. (Note: If the bank has not made or cannot make the opt-out election, there will be no adjustment to be reported in column B.)
c. $100 is the exposure amount subject to risk weighting. This amount will be reported under the appropriate risk weight associated with the exposure (columns C through J).  For a bank that has made the opt-out election, the exposure amount typically will be the carrying value (i.e., fair value) of the debt security excluding any unrealized gain or loss.

* In column C-0% risk weight, the zero percent risk weight applies to exposures to the U.S. government, a U.S. government agency, or a Federal Reserve Bank, and those exposures otherwise unconditionally guaranteed by the U.S. government.  Include exposures to or unconditionally guaranteed by the FDIC or the NCUA.  Certain foreign government exposures and certain entities listed in section 32 of the regulatory capital rules may also qualify for zero percent risk weight.  Include the exposure amounts of securities reported in Schedule RC-B, column C, that do not qualify as securitization exposures that qualify for the zero percent risk weight.  Such securities may include portions of, but may not be limited to: 
   * Item 1, "U.S. Treasury securities," 
   * Item 2.a, Securities "Issued by U.S. Government agencies," 
   * Item 4.a.(1), Residential mortgage pass-through securities "Guaranteed by GNMA,"

   * Any securities categorized as "structured financial products" on Schedule RC-B that are not securitization exposures and qualify for the 20 percent risk weight.  Note:  Many of the structured financial products would be considered securitization exposures and must be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.b, for purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets.  Exclude interest-only securities.
   * The portion of any exposure reported in Schedule RC, item 2.b, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 20 percent risk weight.

* In column H-50% risk weight, include the exposure amounts of those securities reported in Schedule RC-B, column C, that do not qualify as securitization exposures that qualify for the 50 percent risk weight.  Such securities may include portions of, but may not be limited to:
   * Item 3, "Securities issued by states and political subdivisions in the U.S.," that represent revenue obligation securities, 
   * Item 4.a.(3), "Other [residential mortgage] pass-through securities," (that represent residential mortgage exposures that qualify for the 50 percent risk weight.

   * Any securities reported as "structured financial products" in Schedule RC-B, item 5.b, that are not securitization exposures and qualify for the 100 percent risk weight.  Note:  Many of the structured financial products would be considered securitization exposures and must be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.b, for purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets.
   * The portion of any exposure reported in Schedule RC, item 2.b, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 100 percent risk weight.
   * Publicly traded AFS equity exposures and AFS equity exposures to investment funds (including mutual funds), to the extent that the aggregate carrying value of the bank's equity exposures does not exceed 10 percent of total capital.  If the bank's aggregate carrying value of equity exposures is greater than 10 percent of total capital, the bank must report the exposure amount of its AFS equity exposures to investments funds (including mutual funds) in column R (and the risk-weighted asset amount of such AFS equity exposures in column S) and the exposure amount of its other AFS equity exposures in either columns L or N, as appropriate.
   * Also include all other AFS securities that do not qualify as securitization exposures reported in Schedule RC, item 2.b, that are not included in columns C through H, J through N, or R. 

* In column J-150% risk weight, include the exposure amounts of securities reported in Schedule RC-B, column C, that are past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status (except sovereign exposures), excluding those portions that are covered by qualifying collateral or eligible guarantees as described in section 37 and section 36, respectively, of the regulatory capital rules.
 
* In column K-250% risk weight, include the portion that does not qualify as a securitization exposure of Schedule RC, item 2.b, that represents the adjusted carrying value of exposures that are significant investments in the common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions that are not deducted from capital.  For further information on the treatment of equity exposures, refer to section 51 to section 53 of the regulatory capital rules.  This risk weight takes effect in 2018, and therefore this item is blocked from being completed until that time.  Before 2018, report such significant investments in the 100 percent risk weight category. 

* In column L-300% risk weight, for publicly traded AFS equity securities with readily determinable fair values reported in Schedule RC-B, item 7, include the fair value of these equity securities (as reported in Schedule RC-B, item 7, column D) if they have a net unrealized loss.

Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of these equity exposures to investment funds as measured under the full look-through approach, the simple modified look-through approach, or the alternative modified look-through approach described in section 53 of the regulatory capital rules.  All three of these approaches require a minimum risk weight of 20 percent.  For further information, refer to the discussion of "Treatment of Equity Exposures" in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II.  

* AFS securities that must be risk-weighted according to the Country Risk Classification (CRC) methodology
   * In column C-0% risk weight; column G-20% risk weight; column H-50% risk weight; column I-100% risk weight; column J-150% risk weight.  Assign these exposures to risk-weight categories based on the CRC methodology described above in the General Instructions for Part II.  Include the exposure amounts of those securities reported in Schedule RC-B, column C, that are directly and unconditionally guaranteed by foreign central governments or are exposures to foreign banks that do not qualify as securitization exposures.  Such securities may include portions of, but may not be limited to:
   * Item 4.a.(3), "Other [residential mortgage] pass-through securities,"
   * Item 4.b.(3), "All other residential MBS,"
   * Item 4.c.(1)(b), "Other [commercial mortgage] pass-through securities,"
   * Item 4.c.(2)(b), "All other commercial MBS,"
   * Item 5.a, "Asset-backed securities,"
   * Any securities reported as "structured financial products" in Schedule RC-B, item 5.b, that are not securitization exposures.  Note:  Many structured financial products would be considered securitization exposures and must be reported in Schedule RC R, Part II, item 9.b, for purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets, Item 6.b, "Other foreign debt securities," and
   * Item 7, "Investments in mutual funds and other equity securities with readily determinable fair values."


[13]  Adjusted carrying value applies only to equity exposures and is defined in section 51 of the regulatory capital rules.  In general, it includes an on-balance sheet amount as well as application of conversion factors to determine on-balance sheet equivalents of any off-balance sheet commitments to acquire equity exposures.  For institutions that cannot or have not made the AOCI opt-out election, the on-balance sheet component is equal to the carrying value.  For institutions that have made the AOCI opt-out election, the on-balance sheet component is the carrying value less any net unrealized gains that are reflected in the carrying value but excluded from regulatory capital.  Refer to section 51 for the precise definition.</label>

Also report in column A the face amount of those commercial and similar letters of credit reported in Schedule RC-L, item 4, with an original maturity exceeding one year that do not meet the definition of a securitization exposure as described in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules.  

Under the regulatory capital rules, the unused portion of commitments (facilities) which are unconditionally cancelable (without cause) at any time by the bank (to the extent permitted under applicable law) have a zero percent credit conversion factor.  The unused portion of such unconditionally cancelable commitments should be excluded from this item and reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 19.  For further information, see the instructions for item 19.

Also include in column A the unused portion of all revolving underwriting facilities and note issuance facilities, regardless of maturity.
 
In the case of consumer home equity or mortgage lines of credit secured by liens on 1-4 family residential properties, a bank is deemed able to unconditionally cancel the commitment if, at its option, it can prohibit additional extensions of credit, reduce the credit line, and terminate the commitment to the full extent permitted by relevant federal law.  Retail credit cards and related plans, including overdraft checking plans and overdraft protection programs, are defined to be short-term commitments that should be converted at zero percent and excluded from this item 18.c if the bank has the unconditional right to cancel the line of credit at any time in accordance with applicable law.

For commitments providing for increases in the dollar amount of the commitment, the amount to be converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount and risk weighted is the maximum dollar amount that the bank is obligated to advance at any time during the life of the commitment.  This includes seasonal commitments where the dollar amount of the commitment increases during the customer's peak business period.  In addition, this risk-based capital treatment applies to long-term commitments that contain short-term options which, for a fee, allow the customer to increase the dollar amount of the commitment.  Until the short-term option has expired, the reporting bank must convert and risk weight the amount which it is obligated to lend if the option is exercised.  After the expiration of a short term option which has not been exercised, the unused portion of the original amount of the commitment is to be used in the credit conversion process. 

* In column B, report 50 percent of the amount of unused commitments and the face amount of commercial and similar letters of credit reported in column A.  Note that unused commitments that qualify as securitization exposures as defined in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules should be reported as securitization exposures in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 10.  

* In column C-0% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of unused commitments and commercial and similar letters of credit to counterparties who meet, or that have guarantees or collateral that meets, the criteria for the zero percent risk weight category as described in the instructions for Risk-Weighted Assets and for Schedule RC R, Part II, items 1 through 8, above.

* In column G-20% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of unused commitments and commercial and similar letters of credit to counterparties who meet, or that have guarantees or collateral that meets, the criteria for the 20 percent risk weight category as described in the instructions for Risk-Weighted Assets and for Schedule RC R, Part II, items 1 through 8, above.  Include the credit equivalent amount of commitments that have been conveyed to U.S. depository institutions.  Include the credit equivalent amount of those commercial and similar letters of credit reported in Schedule RC-L, item 4, with an original maturity exceeding one year that have been conveyed to U.S. depository institutions.

* In column H-50% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of unused commitments and commercial and similar letters of credit to counterparties who meet, or that have guarantees or collateral that meets, the criteria for the 50 percent risk weight category as described in the instructions for Risk-Weighted Assets and for Schedule RC R, Part II, items 1 through 8, above. 

* In column I-100% risk weight, include the portion of the credit equivalent amount reported in column B that is not included in columns C through H, J, and R.  Also include the credit equivalent amount of unused commitments and commercial and similar letters of credit to counterparties who meet, or that have guarantees or collateral that meets, the criteria for the 100 percent risk-weight category as described in the instructions for Risk-Weighted Assets and for Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 8, above.

* In columns R and S-Application of Other Risk-Weighting Approaches, include the portion of unused commitments that is secured by qualifying financial collateral that meets the definition of a securitization exposure in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules or is a mutual fund only if the bank chooses to recognize the risk-mitigating effects of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral under the Simple Approach outlined in section 37 of the regulatory capital rules.  Under the Simple Approach, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of an unused commitment may not be less than 20 percent.  
   * Include in column R the portion of unused commitments secured by the fair value of securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral as determined under the Simple Approach.  In addition, the bank must apply the same approach to securitization exposure collateral - either the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach or the Gross-Up Approach - that it applies to determine the risk-weighted asset amounts of its on- and off-balance sheet securitization exposures that are reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 9 and 10.  
   * Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that collateralizes the portion of unused commitments secured by such collateral.  Any remaining portion of the unused commitment that is uncollateralized or collateralized by other qualifying collateral would be reported in columns C through J, as appropriate.

Include OTC credit derivative contracts held for trading purposes and subject to the market risk capital rule.  Do not include centrally cleared derivative contracts.  Do not include OTC derivative contracts that meet the definition of a securitization exposure as described in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules; such derivative contracts must be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 10.   

The credit equivalent amount of an OTC derivative contract to be reported in column B is the sum of its current credit exposure (as reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, Memorandum item 1) plus the potential future exposure over the remaining life of the derivative contract (regardless of its current credit exposure, if any), as described in section 34 of the regulatory capital rules.  The current credit exposure of a derivative contract is (1) the fair value of the contract when that fair value is positive and (2) zero when the fair value of the contract is negative or zero.  The potential future credit exposure of a contract, which is based on the type of contract and the contract's remaining maturity, is determined by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by the appropriate credit conversion factor from the following chart.  The notional principal amounts of the reporting bank's OTC derivatives that are subject to the risk based capital requirements are reported by remaining maturity in Schedule RC-R, Part II, Memorandum items 2.a through 2.g.

Remaining Maturity	Interest Rate	Foreign exchange rate and gold	Credit (investment grade reference assets)	Credit (non-investment grade reference assets)	Equity	Precious metals (except gold)	Other
One year or less	0.0%	1.0%	5.0%	10.0%	6.0%	7.0%	10.0%

Greater than five years	1.5%	7.5%	5.0%	10.0%	10.0%	8.0%	15.0%

Under the banking agencies' regulatory capital rules and for purposes of Schedule RC R, Part II, the existence of a legally enforceable bilateral netting agreement between the reporting bank and a counterparty may be taken into consideration when determining both the current credit exposure and the potential future exposure of derivative contracts.  For further information on the treatment of bilateral netting agreements covering derivative contracts, refer to the instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II, Memorandum item 1, and section 34 of the regulatory capital rules.

When assigning to OTC derivative exposures to risk-weight categories, banks can recognize the risk-mitigating effects of financial collateral by using either the Simple Approach or the Collateral Haircut Approach, as described in section 37 of the regulatory capital rules.

* In column C-0% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of OTC derivative contracts with counterparties who meet, or that have guarantees or collateral that meets, the criteria for the zero percent risk weight category as described in the instructions for Risk Weighted Assets and for Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 8, above.  This includes OTC derivative contracts that are marked-to-market on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent the contracts are collateralized by cash on deposit at the reporting institution. 

* In column F-10% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of OTC derivative contracts that are marked-to-market on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent the contracts are collateralized by a sovereign exposure that qualifies for a zero percent risk weight under section 32 of the regulatory capital rules.

* In column G-20% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of OTC derivative contracts with counterparties who meet, or that have guarantees or collateral that meets, the criteria for the 20 percent risk weight category as described in the instructions for Risk Weighted Assets and for Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 8, above.

* In columns R and S-Application of Other Risk-Weighting Approaches, include the portion of OTC derivative contracts that is secured by qualifying financial collateral that meets the definition of a securitization exposure in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules or is a mutual fund only if the bank chooses to recognize the risk-mitigating effects of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral under the Simple Approach or the Collateral Haircut Approach outlined in section 37 of the regulatory capital rules.  Under the Simple Approach, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of the OTC derivative exposure may not be less than 20 percent.
   * Include in column R the portion of OTC derivative contracts secured by the fair value or adjusted fair value of securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral as determined under the Simple Approach or the Collateral Haircut Approach, respectively; however, the bank must apply the same approach for all OTC derivative contracts.  In addition, if the bank applies the Simple Approach, it must apply the same approach - either the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach or the Gross-Up Approach - that it applies to determine the risk-weighted asset amounts of its on- and off-balance sheet securitization exposures that are reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 9 and 10.  
   * Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that collateralizes the portion of OTC derivative contracts secured by such collateral.  Any remaining portion of the OTC derivative exposure that is uncollateralized or collateralized by other qualifying collateral would be reported in columns C through J, as appropriate.

Do not include centrally cleared derivative contracts that meet the definition of a securitization exposure as described in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules; such derivative contracts must be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 10.

The credit equivalent amount of a centrally cleared derivative contract is the sum of its current credit exposure (as reported in Schedule RC-R, Memorandum item 1), plus the potential future exposure over the remaining life of the derivative contract, plus the fair value of collateral posted by the clearing member client bank and held by the central counterparty (CCP) or a clearing member in a manner that is not bankruptcy remote.  The current credit exposure of a derivative contract is (1) the fair value of the contract when that fair value is positive and (2) zero when the fair value of the contract is negative or zero.  The potential future credit exposure of a contract, which is based on the type of contract and the contract's remaining maturity, is determined by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by the appropriate credit conversion factor from the following chart.  The notional principal amounts of the reporting bank's centrally cleared derivatives that are subject to the risk based capital requirements are reported by remaining maturity in Schedule RC-R, Part II, Memorandum items 3.a through 3.g.

Remaining Maturity	Interest Rate	Foreign exchange rate and gold	Credit (investment grade reference assets)	Credit (non-investment grade reference assets)	Equity	Precious metals (except gold)	Other
One year or less	0.0%	1.0%	5.0%	10.0%	6.0%	7.0%	10.0%
Greater than one year &amp; less than or equal to five years	0.5%	5.0%	5.0%	10.0%	8.0%	7.0%	12.0%
Greater than five years	1.5%	7.5%	5.0%	10.0%	10.0%	8.0%	15.0%

 
* In column C-0% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of centrally cleared derivative contracts with CCPs and other counterparties who meet, or that have guarantees or collateral that meets, the criteria for the zero percent risk-weight category as described in the instructions for Risk Weighted Assets and for Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 8, above.

* In column D-2% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of centrally cleared derivative contracts with Qualified Central Counterparties (QCCPs) where the collateral posted by the bank to the QCCP or clearing member is subject to an arrangement that prevents any losses to the clearing member client due to the joint default or a concurrent insolvency, liquidation, or receivership proceeding of the clearing member and any other clearing member clients of the clearing member; and the clearing member client bank has conducted sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintains sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that in the event of a legal challenge (including one resulting from default or from liquidation, insolvency, or receivership proceeding) the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the arrangements to be legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under the law of the relevant jurisdictions.  See the definition of QCCP in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules.

* In column E-4% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of centrally cleared derivative contracts with QCCPs in all other cases that do not meet the qualification criteria for a 2 percent risk weight, as described in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules.

* In column G-20% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of centrally cleared derivative contracts with CCPs and other counterparties who meet, or that have guarantees or collateral that meets, the criteria for the 20 percent risk-weight category as described in the instructions for Risk Weighted Assets and for Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 8, above.

* In column H-50% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of centrally cleared derivative contracts with CCPs and other counterparties who meet, or that have guarantees or collateral that meets, the criteria for the 50 percent risk-weight category as described in the instructions for Risk Weighted Assets and for Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 8, above.

* In column I-100% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of centrally cleared derivative contracts with CCPs and other counterparties who meet, or that have guarantees or collateral that meets, the criteria for the 100 percent risk-weight category as described in the instructions for Risk Weighted Assets and for Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 8, above.  Also include the portion of the credit equivalent amount reported in column B that is not included in columns C through H and J.

For delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transactions [27] and payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions,[28] report in column A the positive current exposure of those unsettled transactions with a normal settlement period in which the reporting bank's counterparty has not made delivery or payment within five business days after the settlement date, which are the DvP and PvP transactions subject to risk weighting under section 38 of the regulatory capital rules.  Positive current exposure is equal to the difference between the transaction value at the agreed settlement price and the current market price of the transaction, if the difference results in a credit exposure of the bank to the counterparty.

For delayed non-DvP/non-PvP transactions,[29] also include in column A the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the bank by the counterparty in those transactions with a normal settlement period in which the reporting bank has delivered cash, securities, commodities, or currencies to its counterparty, but has not received its corresponding deliverables, which are the non-DvP/non-PvP transactions subject to risk weighting under section 38 of the regulatory capital rules.

Do not include in this item:  (1) cleared transactions that are marked-to-market daily and subject to daily receipt and payment of variation margin; (2) repo-style transactions, including unsettled repo-style transactions; (3) one-way cash payments on over-the-counter derivatives; and (4) transactions with a contractual settlement period that is longer than the normal settlement period (generally greater than 5 business days).

* In column C-0% risk weight, include the fair value of deliverables owed to the bank by a counterparty that qualifies for a zero percent risk weight under section 32 of the regulatory capital rules that have been delayed one to four business days for non-DvP/non-PvP transactions.

Report the amount of the bank's standardized market risk-weighted assets.  This item is applicable only to those banks covered by Subpart F of the regulatory capital rules (i.e., the market risk capital rule), as provided in section 201 of the regulatory capital rules.

A bank's measure for market risk for its covered positions is the sum of its value-at-risk (VaR)-based, stressed VaR-based, incremental risk, and comprehensive risk capital requirements plus its specific risk add-ons and any capital requirement for de minimis exposures.  A bank's market risk-weighted assets equal its measure for market risk multiplied by 12.5 (the reciprocal of the minimum 8.0 percent capital ratio).

A covered position is a trading asset or trading liability (whether on- or off-balance sheet), as reported on Schedule RC-D, that is held for any of the following reasons:

(1) For the purpose of short-term resale;
(2) With the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements;
(3) To lock in arbitrage profits; or
(4) To hedge another covered position.

Additionally, the trading asset or trading liability must be free of any restrictive covenants on its tradability or the bank must be able to hedge the material risk elements of the trading asset or trading liability in a two-way market.  A covered position also includes a foreign exchange or commodity position, regardless of whether the position is a trading asset or trading liability (excluding structural foreign currency positions if supervisory approval has been granted to exclude such positions).

A covered position does not include:
	
(1) An intangible asset (including any servicing asset);
(2) A hedge of a trading position that is outside the scope of the bank's hedging strategy;
(3) Any position that, in form or substance, acts as a liquidity facility that provides support to asset-backed commercial paper;
(4) A credit derivative recognized as a guarantee for risk-weighted asset calculation purposes under the regulatory capital rules for credit risk;
(5) An equity position that is not publicly traded (other than a derivative that references a publicly traded equity);
(6) A position held with the intent to securitize; or
(7) A direct real estate holding.</label>

Banks that are subject to Subpart F of the regulatory capital rules should exclude all covered positions subject to these guidelines, except for foreign exchange derivatives that are outside of the trading account.  Foreign exchange derivatives that are outside of the trading account and all over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continue to have a counterparty credit risk capital charge and, therefore, a current credit exposure amount for these derivatives should be reported in this item.

Include the current credit exposure arising from credit derivative contracts where the bank is the protection purchaser (beneficiary) and the credit derivative contract is either (a) defined as a covered position under the market risk capital rule or (b) not defined as a covered position under the market risk capital rule and not recognized as a guarantee for regulatory capital purposes.  

Written option contracts except for those that are, in substance, financial guarantees, are not covered by the regulatory capital rules.

Purchased options held by the reporting bank that are traded on an exchange are covered by the regulatory capital rules unless such options are subject to a daily variation margin.  Variation margin is defined as the gain or loss on open positions, calculated by marking to market at the end of each trading day.  Such gain or loss is credited or debited by the clearing house to each clearing member's account, and by members to their customers' accounts.

If a written option contract acts as a financial guarantee that does not meet the definition of a securitization exposure as described in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules, then for risk-based capital purposes the notional amount of the option should be included in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 17, column A, as part of "All other off-balance sheet liabilities."  An example of such a contract occurs when the reporting bank writes a put option to a second bank that has a loan to a third party.  The strike price would be the equivalent of the par value of the loan.  If the credit quality of the loan deteriorates, thereby reducing the value of the loan to the second bank, the reporting bank would be required by the second bank to take the loan onto its books.

Do not include derivative contracts that meet the definition of a securitization exposure as described in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules; such derivative contracts must be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 10.   

Current credit exposure (sometimes referred to as the replacement cost) is the fair value of a derivative contract when that fair value is positive.  The current credit exposure is zero when the fair value is negative or zero.  Current credit exposure should be derived as follows:  Determine whether a qualifying master netting agreement, as defined in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules, is in place between the reporting bank and a counterparty.  If such an agreement is in place, the fair values of all applicable derivative contracts with that counterparty that are included in the netting agreement are netted to a single amount.  

Next, for all other contracts covered by the regulatory capital rules that have positive fair values, the total of the positive fair values is determined.  Then, report in this item the sum of (i) the net positive fair values of applicable derivative contracts subject to qualifying master netting agreements and (ii) the total positive fair values of all other contracts covered by the regulatory capital rules for both OTC and centrally cleared contracts.  The current credit exposure reported in this item is a component of the credit equivalent amount of derivative contracts that is to be reported in Schedule RC-R, items 20 or 21, column B, depending on whether the contracts are centrally cleared.</label>

The amount of those HTM securities reported in Schedule RC, item 2.a, that qualify as securitization exposures are to be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.a, column A.

Exposure amount to be used for purposes of risk weighting - bank cannot or has not made the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a: For a security classified as HTM where the bank cannot or has not made the AOCI opt-out election (i.e., most AOCI is included in regulatory capital), the exposure amount to be risk weighted by the bank is the carrying value of the security, which is the value of the asset reported (a) on the balance sheet of the bank determined in accordance with GAAP and (b) in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.a, column A. Exposure amount to be used for purposes of risk weighting - bank has made the AOCI opt out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a: For a security classified as HTM where the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election (i.e., most AOCI is not included in regulatory capital), the exposure amount to be risk weighted by the bank is the carrying value of the security reported (a) on the balance sheet of the bank and (b) in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.a, column A, less any net unrealized gain on the exposure plus any net unrealized loss on the exposure included in AOCI. For purposes of determining the exposure amount of an HTM security, an unrealized gain (loss), if any, on such a security that is included in AOCI is (i) the unamortized balance of the unrealized gain (loss) that existed at the date of transfer of a debt security transferred into the held to maturity category from the available for sale category, or (ii) the unaccreted portion of other-than-temporary impairment losses on an HTM debt security that was not recognized in earnings in accordance with ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities (formerly FASB Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities"). Thus, for an HTM security with such an unrealized gain (loss), report in column B any difference between the carrying value of the security reported in column A of this item and its exposure amount reported under the appropriate risk weighting column C through J. * In column C-0% risk weight. The zero percent risk weight applies to exposures to the U.S. government, a U.S. government agency, or a Federal Reserve Bank, and those exposures otherwise unconditionally guaranteed by the U.S. government. Include exposures to or unconditionally guaranteed by the FDIC or the NCUA. Certain foreign government exposures and certain entities listed in section 32 of the regulatory capital rules may also qualify for the zero percent risk weight. Include the exposure amounts of securities reported in Schedule RC-B, column A, that do not qualify as securitization exposures that qualify for the zero percent risk weight. Such securities may include portions of, but may not be limited to: * Item 1, "U.S. Treasury securities," * Item 2.a, Securities "Issued by U.S. Government agencies," * Item 4.a.(1), Residential mortgage pass-through securities "Guaranteed by GNMA," * Item 4.b.(1), those other residential mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies, such as GNMA exposures, * Item 4.c.(1)(a), those commercial mortgage-backed securities (MBS) "Issued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA" that represent GNMA securities, and * Item 4.c.(2)(a), those commercial MBS "Issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies or sponsored agencies" that represent GNMA securities. * The portion of any exposure reported in Schedule RC, item 2.a, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the zero percent risk weight. * In column G-20% risk weight. The 20 percent risk weight applies to general obligations of U.S. states, municipalities, and U.S. public sector entities. It also applies to exposures to U.S. depository institutions and credit unions, exposures conditionally guaranteed by the U.S. government, as well as exposures to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. Certain foreign government and foreign bank exposures may qualify as indicated in section 32 of the regulatory capital rules.

Note: Many of the structured financial products would be considered securitization exposures and must be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.a, for purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets. * The portion of any exposure reported in Schedule RC, item 2.a, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 20 percent risk weight. * In column H-50% risk weight, include the exposure amounts of securities reported in Schedule RC-B, column A, that do not qualify as securitization exposures that qualify for the 50 percent risk weight.

The fair value of those AFS securities reported in Schedule RC, item 2.b, that qualify as securitization exposures must be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.b, column A. The sum of Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 2.b and 9.b, column A, must equal Schedule RC, item 2.b. Exposure amounts to be used for purposes of risk weighting by a bank that cannot or has not made the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a: For a security classified as AFS where the bank cannot or has not made the AOCI opt-out election (i.e., most AOCI is included in regulatory capital), the exposure amount to be risk weighted by the bank is: * For debt securities: the carrying value, which is the value of the asset reported on the balance sheet of the bank determined in accordance with GAAP (i.e., the fair value of the AFS debt security) and in column A. * For equity securities and preferred stock classified as an equity under GAAP: the adjusted carrying value.[13] Exposure amounts to be used for purposes of risk weighting by a bank that has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a: For a security classified as AFS where the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election (i.e., most AOCI is not included in regulatory capital), the exposure amount to be risk weighted by the bank is: * For debt securities: the carrying value, less any net unrealized gains on the exposure plus any net realized loss on the exposure included in AOCI. * For equity securities and preferred stock classified as an equity under GAAP: the carrying value less any net unrealized gains that are reflected in such carrying value but are excluded from the bank's regulatory capital components. * In column B, a bank that has made the AOCI opt-out election should include the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of those AFS debt securities that do not qualify as securitization exposures. This difference equals the amounts reported in Schedule RC-B, items 1 through 6, column D, minus items 1 through 6, column C, for those AFS debt securities included in these items that are not securitization exposures. * When fair value exceeds cost, report the difference as a positive number in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.b, column B. * When cost exceeds fair value, report the difference as a negative number (i.e., with a minus (-) sign) in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.b, column B. * If AFS equity securities with readily determinable fair values have a net unrealized gain (i.e., Schedule RC-B, item 7, column D, exceeds item 7, column C), the portion of the net unrealized gain (55 percent or more) not included in Tier 2 capital should be included in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.b, column B. The portion that is not included in Tier 2 capital equals Schedule RC-B, item 7, column D minus column C, minus Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 31. Example: A bank reports an AFS debt security that is not a securitization exposure on its balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 2.b, at a carrying value (i.e., fair value) of $105. The amortized cost of the debt security is $100. The bank has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a. The AFS debt security has a $5 unrealized gain that is included in AOCI. In Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.b, the bank would report in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.b: a. $105 in column A. This is the carrying value of the AFS debt security on the bank's balance sheet. b. $5 in column B. This is the difference between the carrying value (i.e., fair value) of the debt security and its exposure amount that is subject to risk weighting. For a bank that has made the AOCI opt-out election, column B will typically represent the amount of the unrealized gain or unrealized loss on the security. Gains are reported as positive numbers; losses as negative numbers. (Note: If the bank has not made or cannot make the opt-out election, there will be no adjustment to be reported in column B.) c. $100 is the exposure amount subject to risk weighting. This amount will be reported under the appropriate risk weight associated with the exposure (columns C through J). For a bank that has made the opt-out election, the exposure amount typically will be the carrying value (i.e., fair value) of the debt security excluding any unrealized gain or loss. * In column C-0% risk weight, the zero percent risk weight applies to exposures to the U.S. government, a U.S. government agency, or a Federal Reserve Bank, and those exposures otherwise unconditionally guaranteed by the U.S. government. Include exposures to or unconditionally guaranteed by the FDIC or the NCUA. Certain foreign government exposures and certain entities listed in section 32 of the regulatory capital rules may also qualify for zero percent risk weight. Include the exposure amounts of securities reported in Schedule RC-B, column C, that do not qualify as securitization exposures that qualify for the zero percent risk weight. Such securities may include portions of, but may not be limited to: * Item 1, "U.S. Treasury securities," * Item 2.a, Securities "Issued by U.S. Government agencies," * Item 4.a.(1), Residential mortgage pass-through securities "Guaranteed by GNMA," * Portions of item 4.b.(1), Other residential mortgage-backed securities (MBS) "Issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies or sponsored agencies," such as GNMA exposures, * Item 4.c.(1)(a), certain portions of commercial MBS "Issued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA" that represent GNMA securities, and * Item 4.c.(2)(a), certain portions of commercial MBS "Issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies or sponsored agencies" that represent GNMA securities. * The portion of any exposure reported in Schedule RC, item 2.b, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the zero percent risk weight. * In column G-20% risk weight, the 20 percent risk weight applies to general obligations of U.S. states, municipalities, and U.S. public sector entities. It also applies to exposures to U.S. depository institutions and credit unions, exposures conditionally guaranteed by the U.S. government, as well as exposures to U.S. government sponsored enterprises. Certain foreign government and foreign bank exposures may qualify for the 20 percent risk weight as indicated in section 32 of the regulatory capital rules. Include the exposure amounts of those securities reported in Schedule RC-B, column C, that do not qualify as securitization exposures that qualify for the 20 percent risk weight.

Note: Many of the structured financial products would be considered securitization exposures and must be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.b, for purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets. Exclude interest-only securities. * The portion of any exposure reported in Schedule RC, item 2.b, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 20 percent risk weight. * In column H-50% risk weight, include the exposure amounts of those securities reported in Schedule RC-B, column C, that do not qualify as securitization exposures that qualify for the 50 percent risk weight. Such securities may include portions of, but may not be limited to: * Item 3, "Securities issued by states and political subdivisions in the U.S.," that represent revenue obligation securities, * Item 4.a.(3), "Other [residential mortgage] pass-through securities," (that represent residential mortgage exposures that qualify for the 50 percent risk weight.

If the bank's aggregate carrying value of equity exposures is greater than 10 percent of total capital, the bank must report the exposure amount of its AFS equity exposures to investments funds (including mutual funds) in column R (and the risk-weighted asset amount of such AFS equity exposures in column S) and the exposure amount of its other AFS equity exposures in either columns L or N, as appropriate. * Also include all other AFS securities that do not qualify as securitization exposures reported in Schedule RC, item 2.b, that are not included in columns C through H, J through N, or R. * In column J-150% risk weight, include the exposure amounts of securities reported in Schedule RC-B, column C, that are past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status (except sovereign exposures), excluding those portions that are covered by qualifying collateral or eligible guarantees as described in section 37 and section 36, respectively, of the regulatory capital rules. * In column K-250% risk weight, include the portion that does not qualify as a securitization exposure of Schedule RC, item 2.b, that represents the adjusted carrying value of exposures that are significant investments in the common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions that are not deducted from capital. For further information on the treatment of equity exposures, refer to section 51 to section 53 of the regulatory capital rules. This risk weight takes effect in 2018, and therefore this item is blocked from being completed until that time. Before 2018, report such significant investments in the 100 percent risk weight category. * In column L-300% risk weight, for publicly traded AFS equity securities with readily determinable fair values reported in Schedule RC-B, item 7, include the fair value of these equity securities (as reported in Schedule RC-B, item 7, column D) if they have a net unrealized loss.

If these equity securities have a net unrealized gain, include their adjusted carrying value (as reported in Schedule RC-B, item 7, column C) plus the portion of the unrealized gain (up to 45 percent) included in tier 2 capital (as reported in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 31). * In columns R and S - Application of Other Risk-Weighting Approaches, include the bank's AFS equity exposures to investment funds (including mutual funds) if the aggregate carrying value of the bank's equity exposures is greater than 10 percent of total capital. Report in column R the exposure amount of these equity exposures to investment funds. Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of these equity exposures to investment funds as measured under the full look-through approach, the simple modified look-through approach, or the alternative modified look-through approach described in section 53 of the regulatory capital rules. All three of these approaches require a minimum risk weight of 20 percent. For further information, refer to the discussion of "Treatment of Equity Exposures" in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II. * AFS securities that must be risk-weighted according to the Country Risk Classification (CRC) methodology * In column C-0% risk weight; column G-20% risk weight; column H-50% risk weight; column I-100% risk weight; column J-150% risk weight. Assign these exposures to risk-weight categories based on the CRC methodology described above in the General Instructions for Part II. Include the exposure amounts of those securities reported in Schedule RC-B, column C, that are directly and unconditionally guaranteed by foreign central governments or are exposures to foreign banks that do not qualify as securitization exposures.

Note: Many structured financial products would be considered securitization exposures and must be reported in Schedule RC R, Part II, item 9.b, for purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets, Item 6.b, "Other foreign debt securities," and * Item 7, "Investments in mutual funds and other equity securities with readily determinable fair values." [13] Adjusted carrying value applies only to equity exposures and is defined in section 51 of the regulatory capital rules. In general, it includes an on-balance sheet amount as well as application of conversion factors to determine on-balance sheet equivalents of any off-balance sheet commitments to acquire equity exposures. For institutions that cannot or have not made the AOCI opt-out election, the on-balance sheet component is equal to the carrying value. For institutions that have made the AOCI opt-out election, the on-balance sheet component is the carrying value less any net unrealized gains that are reflected in the carrying value but excluded from regulatory capital. Refer to section 51 for the precise definition.</label>

Also include the portion of any exposure that meets the definition of residential mortgage exposure or statutory multifamily mortgage reported in Schedule RC, item 4.a, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 50 percent risk weight. Notes: 1. Refer to the definition of "residential mortgage exposure" in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules, and refer to the requirements for risk weighting residential mortgage loans in section 32 of the regulatory capital rules. 2. A residential mortgage loan may receive a 50 percent risk weight if it meets the qualifying criteria in section 32(g) of the regulatory capital rules: * A property is owner-occupied or rented; * The loan is prudently underwritten including the loan amount as a percentage of the appraised value of the real estate collateral. * The loan is not 90 days or more past due or on nonaccrual; * The loan is not restructured or modified (except for loans restructured solely pursuant to the U.S. Treasury's HAMP). * If the bank holds the first lien and junior lien(s) on a residential mortgage exposure, and no other party holds an intervening lien, the bank must combine the exposures and treat them as a single first-lien residential mortgage exposure. 4. A first lien home equity line (HELOC) may qualify for 50 percent risk weight if it meets the qualifying criteria. 5. A residential mortgage loan of $1 million or less on a property of more than 4 units may qualify for 50 percent risk weight if it meets the qualifying criteria. * In column I-100% risk weight, include the carrying value of HFS loans that are residential mortgage exposures reported in Schedule RC, item 4.a, that are not included in columns C, G, H, or R. Also include the portion of any exposure that meets the definition of residential mortgage exposure or statutory multifamily mortgage reported in Schedule RC, item 4.a, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 100 percent risk weight. * In columns R and S-Application of Other Risk-Weighting Approaches, include the portion of any HFS exposure reported in Schedule RC, item 4.a, that meets the definition of residential mortgage exposure or statutory multifamily mortgage and is secured by qualifying financial collateral that meets the definition of a securitization exposure in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules or is a mutual fund only if the bank chooses to recognize the risk-mitigating effects of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral under the Simple Approach outlined in section 37 of the regulatory capital rules. Under the Simple Approach, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of the exposure may not be less than 20 percent. * Include in column R the carrying value of the portion of an HFS exposure that is secured by the fair value of securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that meets the general requirements of the Simple Approach in section 37. In addition, the bank must apply the same approach to securitization exposure collateral - either the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach or the Gross-Up Approach - that it applies to determine the risk-weighted asset amounts of its on- and off-balance sheet securitization exposures that are reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 9 and 10. * Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that collateralizes the portion of the HFS exposure secured by such collateral. Any remaining portion of the HFS exposure that is uncollateralized or collateralized by other qualifying collateral would be reported in columns C through I, as appropriate.

The amount of those assets reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that qualify as securitization exposures must be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.d, column A. The sum of item 8, columns B through R (including items 8.a and 8.b, column R), must equal item 8, column A. Treatment of Defined Benefit Postretirement Plan Assets - Applicable Only to Banks That Have Made the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) Opt-Out Election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a If the reporting institution sponsors a single-employer defined benefit postretirement plan, such as a pension plan or health care plan, accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 715-20, Compensation-Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans-General (formerly FASB Statement No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans"), the institution should adjust the asset amount reported in column A of this item for any amounts included in Schedule RC, item 26.b, "Accumulated other comprehensive income," affecting assets as a result of the initial and subsequent application of the funded status and measurement date provisions of ASC Subtopic 715 20. The adjustment also should take into account subsequent amortization of these amounts from AOCI into earnings. The intent of the adjustment reported in this item (together with the amount reported in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 9.d) is to reverse the effects on AOCI of applying ASC Subtopic 715-20 for regulatory capital purposes. Specifically, assets recognized or derecognized as an adjustment to AOCI as part of the incremental effect of applying ASC Subtopic 715-20 should be reported as an adjustment to assets in column B of this item. For example, the derecognition of an asset recorded as an offset to AOCI as part of the initial incremental effect of applying ASC Subtopic 715-20 should be reported in this item as a negative amount in column B and as a positive amount in column I. As another example, the portion of a benefit plan surplus asset that is included in Schedule RC, item 26.b, as an increase to AOCI and in column A of this item should be excluded from risk weighted assets by reporting the amount as a positive number in column B of this item. * In column B, include the amount of: * Any goodwill net of associated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) reported in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 6; * Intangible assets (other than goodwill and mortgage servicing assets (MSAs)), net of associated DTLs reported in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 7; * Deferred tax assets (DTAs) that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, net of any related valuation allowances and net of DTLs reported in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 8; * The fair value of derivative contracts that are reported as assets in Schedule RC, item 11 (banks should risk weight the credit equivalent amount of these derivative contracts in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 20 or 21, as appropriate); * Items subject to the 10 percent and 15 percent common equity tier 1 capital threshold limitations that have been deducted for risk-based capital purposes in Schedule RC R, Part I, items 13 through 16. These excess amounts pertain to three items: * Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock; * MSAs; and * DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, net of related valuation allowances; * The bank's investments in unconsolidated banking and finance subsidiaries that are reported in Schedule RC, item 8, and have been deducted for risk-based capital purposes in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 33; and * Unsettled transactions (failed trades) that are reported as "Other assets" in Schedule RC, item 11. For purposes of risk weighting, unsettled transactions are to be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 22. Report as a negative number in column B the amount of default fund contributions in the form of commitments made by a clearing member to a central counterparty's mutualized loss-sharing arrangement. * In column C-0% risk weight, include: * The carrying value of Federal Reserve Bank stock included in Schedule RC-F, item 4; * Accrued interest receivable on assets included in the zero percent risk weight category (column C of Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 7); * The carrying value of gold bullion not held for trading that is held in the bank's own vault or in another bank's vault on an allocated basis, and exposures that arise from the settlement of cash transactions (such as equities, fixed income, spot foreign exchange, and spot commodities) with a central counterparty where there is no assumption of ongoing credit risk by the central counterparty after settlement of the trade and associated default fund contributions; and * The portion of assets reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the zero percent risk weight. This would include the portion of these assets collateralized by deposits in the reporting institution. * In column G-20% risk weight, include: * The carrying value of Federal Home Loan Bank stock included in Schedule RC-F, item 4; * Accrued interest receivable on assets included in the 20 percent risk weight category (column G of Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 7); * The portion of customers' acceptance liability reported in Schedule RC, item 11, that has been participated to other depository institutions; and * The portion of assets reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 20 percent risk weight.

If the bank's aggregate carrying value of equity exposures is greater than 10 percent of total capital, the bank must report its equity exposures reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, in either columns L, M, or N, as appropriate; and * The portion of assets reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 100 percent risk weight. * In column J-150% risk weight, include accrued interest receivable on assets included in the 150 percent risk weight category (column J of Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 7). Also include the portion of assets reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 150 percent risk weight. * In column L-300% risk weight, include the fair value of publicly traded equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are reported in Schedule RC, items 8 and 9. * In column M-400% risk weight, include the historical cost of equity securities (other than those issued by investment firms) that do not have readily determinable fair values that are reported in Schedule RC-F, item 4. * In column N-600% risk weight, include the historical cost of equity securities issued by investment firms that do not have readily determinable fair values that are reported in Schedule RC-F, item 4. * In columns R and S-Application of Other Risk-Weighting Approaches, include the portion of any asset reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that is secured by qualifying financial collateral that meets the definition of a securitization exposure in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules or is a mutual fund only if the bank chooses to recognize the risk-mitigating effects of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral under the Simple Approach outlined in section 37 of the regulatory capital rules. Under the Simple Approach, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of the exposure may not be less than 20 percent. * Include in column R the carrying value of the portion of an asset that is secured by the fair value of securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that meets the general requirements of the Simple Approach in section 37. In addition, the bank must apply the same approach to securitization exposure collateral - either the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach or the Gross-up Approach - that it applies to determine the risk-weighted asset amounts of its on- and off-balance sheet securitization exposures that are reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 9 and 10. * Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that collateralizes the portion of the asset secured by such collateral. Any remaining portion of the asset that is uncollateralized or collateralized by other qualifying collateral would be reported in columns C through J. For further information, see the discussions of "Treatment of Collateral and Guarantees" and "Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures" in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II. * In columns R and S-Application of Other Risk-Weighting Approaches, also include the bank's equity exposures to investment funds (including mutual funds) reported in Schedule RC, item 8 or 11, if the aggregate carrying value of the bank's equity exposures is greater than 10 percent of total capital. Report in column R the exposure amount of these equity exposures to investment funds. Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of these equity exposures to investment funds as measured under the full look-through approach, the simple modified look-through approach, or the alternative modified look-through approach described in section 53 of the regulatory capital rules. All three of these approaches require a minimum risk weight of 20 percent. For further information, refer to the discussion of "Treatment of Equity Exposures" in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II. * In columns R and S of item 8.a-Separate Account Bank-Owned Life Insurance, include the bank's investments in separate account life insurance products, including hybrid separate account life insurance products. Exclude from columns R and S any investment in bank-owned life insurance that is solely a general account insurance product (report such general account insurance products in column I-100 percent risk weight). Report in column R the carrying value of the bank's investments in separate account life insurance products, including hybrid separate account products. Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of these insurance products. When a bank has a separate account policy, the portion of the carrying value that represents general account claims on the insurer, including items such as deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and mortality reserves realizable as of the balance sheet date, and any portion of the carrying value attributable to a Stable Value Protection (SVP) contract should be risk weighted at the 100 percent risk weight as claims on the insurer or the SVP provider. The remaining portion of the investment in separate account life insurance products is an equity exposure to an investment fund that should be measured under the full look-through approach, the simple modified look-through approach, or the alternative modified look-through approach, all three of which require a minimum risk weight of 20 percent. For further information, refer to the discussion of "Treatment of Equity Exposures" in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II. * In columns R and S of item 8.b-Default Fund Contributions to Central Counterparties Note: Item 8.b only applies to banks that are clearing members, and therefore will not be applicable to the vast majority of banks. Banks must report the aggregate on-balance sheet amount of default fund contributions to central counterparties (CCPs) in column A. Banks must report the aggregate off-balance sheet amount, if any, of default fund contributions to CCPs as a negative amount in column B of item 8. Banks must report the aggregate on- and off-balance sheet amount of such contributions in column R. See section 35(d) of the regulatory capital rules for more details. Clearing Member Banks must report in column S the total amount of risk-weighted assets for a clearing member bank's default fund contributions to CCPs. This will be the sum of: * Component A: the sum of risk-weighted assets for a clearing member bank's default fund contributions to all non-qualifying CCPs; and, * Component B: the sum of risk-weighted assets for a clearing member bank's default fund contributions to all qualifying central counterparties (QCCPs). Report the sum of Components A and B in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 8.b, column S. Component A: risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to non-qualifying CCPs As required by section 35(d)(2) of the regulatory capital rules, a clearing member bank's risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to CCPs that are not QCCPs equals the sum of such default fund contributions multiplied by 1,250 percent, or an amount determined by the bank's federal supervisor based on factors such as size, structure and membership characteristics of the CCP and riskiness of its transactions, in cases where such default fund contributions may be unlimited. Therefore, unless otherwise advised by its supervisor or through agency-issued guidance, a bank will sum each of its non-QCCP default fund contributions, and multiply the total by 1,250 percent, and add any additional risk-weighted asset amount determined by the agency, if any. This will be Component A above. Component B: risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to QCCPs Section 35(d)(3) of the regulatory capital rules provides two methods to determine the capital requirement for a clearing member bank's default fund contributions to a QCCP. A clearing member bank may use either method. A clearing member bank's risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to a QCCP equals the sum of its capital requirement, KCM, for each QCCP as calculated under Method 1 multiplied by 1,250 percent, or under Method 2. Method 1: The bank calculates the capital charge for a clearing member in a 3-step process, depending on the funded status of the QCCP. The process is summarized briefly below: * Step 1: The bank must calculate the hypothetical capital requirement of all the trades conducted through the QCCP as if the QCCP were a bank. This depends on the type of trade and netting sets with each counterparty. Alternately, the QCCP may provide this number to the clearing member. * Step 2: The bank compares the hypothetical capital requirement (calculated in Step 1) to the funded default fund of the QCCP to include the internally funded resources of the QCCP. This step determines the aggregate capital requirement for all clearing members assuming a default of two average clearing members. * Step 3: The aggregate capital requirement of all clearing members (assuming the default of two members) is then allocated back to the individual clearing member firm and converted to a risk-weighted asset amount. Using the 3-step process and formulas provided in the regulatory capital rules, the bank will determine a dollar capital requirement for its default fund contribution for each QCCP (KCMi). The bank must then multiply each KCMi by 1,250 percent to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount. The bank must sum the risk-weighted assets calculated for each QCCP default fund contribution to produce a total risk-weighted asset amount for all QCCP default fund contributions for which the bank uses this method. For example, the total risk-weight asset amount for a bank with default fund contributions to two QCCPs will be the sum of KCMi for QCCP A and KCMi for QCCP B. This sum will be included in Component B above for all QCCPs for which the bank uses Method 1. Method 2: Under Method 2, the risk-weighted assets for a clearing member's default fund contribution is the minimum of: * 1,250 percent times the bank's funded contributions to the QCCP default fund, or, * 18 percent times the total trade exposures of the member to the QCCP. A bank will make this calculation for each QCCP for which it uses Method 2. The sum of risk-weighted assets for all QCCP contributions for which the bank uses Method 2 will be included in Component B above. * The portion of Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that must be risk-weighted according to the Country Risk Classification (CRC) methodology: * In column C-0% risk weight; column G-20% risk weight; column H-50% risk weight; column I-100% risk weight; column J-150% risk weight. Assign these exposures to risk-weight categories based on the CRC methodology described above in the General Instructions for Part II. Include the portions of those exposures described above in the instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 8 that are exposures on sovereigns or foreign banks that do not qualify as securitization exposures. [17] Note: These items will become subject to a 250 percent risk weight beginning in 2018.</label>

For 1-4 family residential mortgages, the loans must be prudently underwritten, be fully secured by first liens on 1-4 family or multifamily residential properties, not 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status, and have not been restructured or modified (unless modified or restructured solely pursuant to the U.S. Treasury's Home Affordable Mortgage Program (HAMP)). Also include loans, net of unearned income, that meet the definition of statutory multifamily mortgage in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules. Also include the portion of any loan, net of unearned income, which meets the definition of residential mortgage exposure or statutory multifamily mortgage reported in Schedule RC, item 4.b, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 50 percent risk weight. Notes: 1. Refer to the definition of "residential mortgage exposure" in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules, and refer to the requirements for risk weighting residential mortgage loans in section 32 of the regulatory capital rules. 2. A residential mortgage loan may receive a 50 percent risk weight if it meets the qualifying criteria in section 32(g) of the regulatory capital rules: * A property is owner-occupied or rented; * The loan is prudently underwritten including the loan amount as a percentage of the appraised value of the real estate collateral. * The loan is not 90 days or more past due or on nonaccrual; * The loan is not restructured or modified (except for loans restructured solely pursuant to the U.S. Treasury's HAMP). * If the bank holds the first lien and junior lien(s) on a residential mortgage exposure, and no other party holds an intervening lien, the bank must combine the exposures and treat them as a single first-lien residential mortgage exposure. 4. A first lien home equity line (HELOC) may qualify for 50 percent risk weight if it meets the qualifying criteria. 5. A residential mortgage loan of $1 million or less on a property of more than 4 units may qualify for 50 percent risk weight if it meets the qualifying criteria. * In column I-100% risk weight, include the carrying value of loans, net of unearned income, related to residential mortgages exposures reported in Schedule RC, item 4.b, that are not included in columns C, G, H, or R. Also include the portion of any loan, net of unearned income, which meets the definition of residential mortgage exposure or statutory multifamily mortgage reported in Schedule RC, item 4.b, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 100 percent risk weight. * In columns R and S-Application of Other Risk-Weighting Approaches, include the portion of any loan, net of unearned income, reported in Schedule RC, item 4.b, that meets the definition of residential mortgage exposure or statutory multifamily mortgage and is secured by qualifying financial collateral that meets the definition of a securitization exposure in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules or is a mutual fund only if the bank chooses to recognize the risk-mitigating effects of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral under the Simple Approach outlined in section 37 of the regulatory capital rules. Under the Simple Approach, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of the exposure may not be less than 20 percent. * Include in column R the carrying value of the portion of a loan exposure that is secured by the fair value of securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that meets the general requirements of the Simple Approach in section 37. In addition, the bank must apply the same approach to securitization exposure collateral - either the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach or the Gross-Up Approach - that it applies to determine the risk-weighted asset amounts of its on- and off-balance sheet securitization exposures that are reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 9 and 10. * Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that collateralizes the portion of the loan exposure secured by such collateral. Any remaining portion of the loan exposure that is uncollateralized or collateralized by other qualifying collateral would be reported in columns C through I, as appropriate.

Under the Simple Approach, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of the exposure may not be less than 20 percent. * Include in column R the fair value of the portion of a trading asset that is secured by the fair value of securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that meets the general requirements of the Simple Approach in section 37. In addition the bank must apply the same approach to securitization exposure collateral - either the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach or the Gross-up Approach - that it applies to determine the risk-weighted asset amounts of its on- and off-balance sheet securitization exposures that are reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 9 and 10. * Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that collateralizes the portion of the trading asset secured by such collateral. Any remaining portion of the trading asset that is uncollateralized or collateralized by other qualifying collateral would be reported in columns C through J. For further information, see the discussions of "Treatment of Collateral and Guarantees" and "Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures" in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II. * In columns R and S-Application of Other Risk-Weighting Approaches, also include the bank's equity exposures to investment funds (including mutual funds) reported as trading assets in Schedule RC, item 5, if the aggregate carrying value of the bank's equity exposures is greater than 10 percent of total capital. Report in column R the exposure amount of these equity exposures to investment funds. Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of these equity exposures to investment funds as measured under the full look-through approach, the simple modified look-through approach, or the alternative modified look-through approach described in section 53 of the regulatory capital rules. All three of these approaches require a minimum risk weight of 20 percent. For further information, refer to the discussion of "Treatment of Equity Exposures" in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II. * Trading assets that must be risk-weighted according to the Country Risk Classification (CRC) methodology * In column C-0% risk weight; column G-20% risk weight; column H-50% risk weight; column I-100% risk weight; column J-150% risk weight. Assign these exposures to risk-weight categories based on the CRC methodology described above in the General Instructions for Part II. Include the portions of those exposures reported in Schedule RC-D that are directly and unconditionally guaranteed by foreign central governments or are exposures on foreign banks that do not qualify as securitization exposures. Such exposures may include portions of, but may not be limited to: * The fair value of those MBS reported in Schedule RC-D, item 4, "Mortgage-backed securities," (column A on the FFIEC 031), and other debt securities reported in Schedule RC-D, Item 5, "Other debt securities," (column A on the FFIEC 031), issued by foreign banks and foreign sovereign units. * If the bank does not complete Schedule RC-D, include the portion of the amount reported in Schedule RC, item 5, that represents the fair value of the preceding types of trading assets. Exclude those trading assets reported in Schedule RC, item 5, that qualify as securitization exposures and report them in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.c.

The amount of those assets reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that qualify as securitization exposures must be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.d, column A. The sum of item 8, columns B through R (including items 8.a and 8.b, column R), must equal item 8, column A. Treatment of Defined Benefit Postretirement Plan Assets - Applicable Only to Banks That Have Made the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) Opt-Out Election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a If the reporting institution sponsors a single-employer defined benefit postretirement plan, such as a pension plan or health care plan, accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 715-20, Compensation-Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans-General (formerly FASB Statement No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans"), the institution should adjust the asset amount reported in column A of this item for any amounts included in Schedule RC, item 26.b, "Accumulated other comprehensive income," affecting assets as a result of the initial and subsequent application of the funded status and measurement date provisions of ASC Subtopic 715 20. The adjustment also should take into account subsequent amortization of these amounts from AOCI into earnings. The intent of the adjustment reported in this item (together with the amount reported in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 9.d) is to reverse the effects on AOCI of applying ASC Subtopic 715-20 for regulatory capital purposes. Specifically, assets recognized or derecognized as an adjustment to AOCI as part of the incremental effect of applying ASC Subtopic 715-20 should be reported as an adjustment to assets in column B of this item. For example, the derecognition of an asset recorded as an offset to AOCI as part of the initial incremental effect of applying ASC Subtopic 715-20 should be reported in this item as a negative amount in column B and as a positive amount in column I. As another example, the portion of a benefit plan surplus asset that is included in Schedule RC, item 26.b, as an increase to AOCI and in column A of this item should be excluded from risk weighted assets by reporting the amount as a positive number in column B of this item. * In column B, include the amount of: * Any goodwill net of associated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) reported in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 6; * Intangible assets (other than goodwill and mortgage servicing assets (MSAs)), net of associated DTLs reported in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 7; * Deferred tax assets (DTAs) that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, net of any related valuation allowances and net of DTLs reported in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 8; * The fair value of derivative contracts that are reported as assets in Schedule RC, item 11 (banks should risk weight the credit equivalent amount of these derivative contracts in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 20 or 21, as appropriate); * Items subject to the 10 percent and 15 percent common equity tier 1 capital threshold limitations that have been deducted for risk-based capital purposes in Schedule RC R, Part I, items 13 through 16. These excess amounts pertain to three items: * Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock; * MSAs; and * DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, net of related valuation allowances; * The bank's investments in unconsolidated banking and finance subsidiaries that are reported in Schedule RC, item 8, and have been deducted for risk-based capital purposes in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 33; and * Unsettled transactions (failed trades) that are reported as "Other assets" in Schedule RC, item 11. For purposes of risk weighting, unsettled transactions are to be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 22. Report as a negative number in column B the amount of default fund contributions in the form of commitments made by a clearing member to a central counterparty's mutualized loss-sharing arrangement. * In column C-0% risk weight, include: * The carrying value of Federal Reserve Bank stock included in Schedule RC-F, item 4; * Accrued interest receivable on assets included in the zero percent risk weight category (column C of Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 7); * The carrying value of gold bullion not held for trading that is held in the bank's own vault or in another bank's vault on an allocated basis, and exposures that arise from the settlement of cash transactions (such as equities, fixed income, spot foreign exchange, and spot commodities) with a central counterparty where there is no assumption of ongoing credit risk by the central counterparty after settlement of the trade and associated default fund contributions; and * The portion of assets reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the zero percent risk weight. This would include the portion of these assets collateralized by deposits in the reporting institution. * In column G-20% risk weight, include: * The carrying value of Federal Home Loan Bank stock included in Schedule RC-F, item 4; * Accrued interest receivable on assets included in the 20 percent risk weight category (column G of Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 7); * The portion of customers' acceptance liability reported in Schedule RC, item 11, that has been participated to other depository institutions; and * The portion of assets reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 20 percent risk weight.

If the bank's aggregate carrying value of equity exposures is greater than 10 percent of total capital, the bank must report its equity exposures reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, in either columns L, M, or N, as appropriate; and * The portion of assets reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 100 percent risk weight. * In column J-150% risk weight, include accrued interest receivable on assets included in the 150 percent risk weight category (column J of Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 7). Also include the portion of assets reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that is secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 150 percent risk weight. * In column L-300% risk weight, include the fair value of publicly traded equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are reported in Schedule RC, items 8 and 9. * In column M-400% risk weight, include the historical cost of equity securities (other than those issued by investment firms) that do not have readily determinable fair values that are reported in Schedule RC-F, item 4. * In column N-600% risk weight, include the historical cost of equity securities issued by investment firms that do not have readily determinable fair values that are reported in Schedule RC-F, item 4. * In columns R and S-Application of Other Risk-Weighting Approaches, include the portion of any asset reported in Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that is secured by qualifying financial collateral that meets the definition of a securitization exposure in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules or is a mutual fund only if the bank chooses to recognize the risk-mitigating effects of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral under the Simple Approach outlined in section 37 of the regulatory capital rules. Under the Simple Approach, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of the exposure may not be less than 20 percent. * Include in column R the carrying value of the portion of an asset that is secured by the fair value of securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that meets the general requirements of the Simple Approach in section 37. In addition, the bank must apply the same approach to securitization exposure collateral - either the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach or the Gross-up Approach - that it applies to determine the risk-weighted asset amounts of its on- and off-balance sheet securitization exposures that are reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 9 and 10. * Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that collateralizes the portion of the asset secured by such collateral. Any remaining portion of the asset that is uncollateralized or collateralized by other qualifying collateral would be reported in columns C through J. For further information, see the discussions of "Treatment of Collateral and Guarantees" and "Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures" in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II. * In columns R and S-Application of Other Risk-Weighting Approaches, also include the bank's equity exposures to investment funds (including mutual funds) reported in Schedule RC, item 8 or 11, if the aggregate carrying value of the bank's equity exposures is greater than 10 percent of total capital. Report in column R the exposure amount of these equity exposures to investment funds. Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of these equity exposures to investment funds as measured under the full look-through approach, the simple modified look-through approach, or the alternative modified look-through approach described in section 53 of the regulatory capital rules. All three of these approaches require a minimum risk weight of 20 percent. For further information, refer to the discussion of "Treatment of Equity Exposures" in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II. * In columns R and S of item 8.a-Separate Account Bank-Owned Life Insurance, include the bank's investments in separate account life insurance products, including hybrid separate account life insurance products. Exclude from columns R and S any investment in bank-owned life insurance that is solely a general account insurance product (report such general account insurance products in column I-100 percent risk weight). Report in column R the carrying value of the bank's investments in separate account life insurance products, including hybrid separate account products. Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of these insurance products. When a bank has a separate account policy, the portion of the carrying value that represents general account claims on the insurer, including items such as deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and mortality reserves realizable as of the balance sheet date, and any portion of the carrying value attributable to a Stable Value Protection (SVP) contract should be risk weighted at the 100 percent risk weight as claims on the insurer or the SVP provider. The remaining portion of the investment in separate account life insurance products is an equity exposure to an investment fund that should be measured under the full look-through approach, the simple modified look-through approach, or the alternative modified look-through approach, all three of which require a minimum risk weight of 20 percent. For further information, refer to the discussion of "Treatment of Equity Exposures" in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II. * In columns R and S of item 8.b-Default Fund Contributions to Central Counterparties Note: Item 8.b only applies to banks that are clearing members, and therefore will not be applicable to the vast majority of banks. Banks must report the aggregate on-balance sheet amount of default fund contributions to central counterparties (CCPs) in column A. Banks must report the aggregate off-balance sheet amount, if any, of default fund contributions to CCPs as a negative amount in column B of item 8. Banks must report the aggregate on- and off-balance sheet amount of such contributions in column R. See section 35(d) of the regulatory capital rules for more details. Clearing Member Banks must report in column S the total amount of risk-weighted assets for a clearing member bank's default fund contributions to CCPs. This will be the sum of: * Component A: the sum of risk-weighted assets for a clearing member bank's default fund contributions to all non-qualifying CCPs; and, * Component B: the sum of risk-weighted assets for a clearing member bank's default fund contributions to all qualifying central counterparties (QCCPs). Report the sum of Components A and B in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 8.b, column S. Component A: risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to non-qualifying CCPs As required by section 35(d)(2) of the regulatory capital rules, a clearing member bank's risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to CCPs that are not QCCPs equals the sum of such default fund contributions multiplied by 1,250 percent, or an amount determined by the bank's federal supervisor based on factors such as size, structure and membership characteristics of the CCP and riskiness of its transactions, in cases where such default fund contributions may be unlimited. Therefore, unless otherwise advised by its supervisor or through agency-issued guidance, a bank will sum each of its non-QCCP default fund contributions, and multiply the total by 1,250 percent, and add any additional risk-weighted asset amount determined by the agency, if any. This will be Component A above. Component B: risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to QCCPs Section 35(d)(3) of the regulatory capital rules provides two methods to determine the capital requirement for a clearing member bank's default fund contributions to a QCCP. A clearing member bank may use either method. A clearing member bank's risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to a QCCP equals the sum of its capital requirement, KCM, for each QCCP as calculated under Method 1 multiplied by 1,250 percent, or under Method 2. Method 1: The bank calculates the capital charge for a clearing member in a 3-step process, depending on the funded status of the QCCP. The process is summarized briefly below: * Step 1: The bank must calculate the hypothetical capital requirement of all the trades conducted through the QCCP as if the QCCP were a bank. This depends on the type of trade and netting sets with each counterparty. Alternately, the QCCP may provide this number to the clearing member. * Step 2: The bank compares the hypothetical capital requirement (calculated in Step 1) to the funded default fund of the QCCP to include the internally funded resources of the QCCP. This step determines the aggregate capital requirement for all clearing members assuming a default of two average clearing members. * Step 3: The aggregate capital requirement of all clearing members (assuming the default of two members) is then allocated back to the individual clearing member firm and converted to a risk-weighted asset amount. Using the 3-step process and formulas provided in the regulatory capital rules, the bank will determine a dollar capital requirement for its default fund contribution for each QCCP (KCMi). The bank must then multiply each KCMi by 1,250 percent to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount. The bank must sum the risk-weighted assets calculated for each QCCP default fund contribution to produce a total risk-weighted asset amount for all QCCP default fund contributions for which the bank uses this method. For example, the total risk-weight asset amount for a bank with default fund contributions to two QCCPs will be the sum of KCMi for QCCP A and KCMi for QCCP B. This sum will be included in Component B above for all QCCPs for which the bank uses Method 1. Method 2: Under Method 2, the risk-weighted assets for a clearing member's default fund contribution is the minimum of: * 1,250 percent times the bank's funded contributions to the QCCP default fund, or, * 18 percent times the total trade exposures of the member to the QCCP. A bank will make this calculation for each QCCP for which it uses Method 2. The sum of risk-weighted assets for all QCCP contributions for which the bank uses Method 2 will be included in Component B above. * The portion of Schedule RC, items 6 through 11, that must be risk-weighted according to the Country Risk Classification (CRC) methodology: * In column C-0% risk weight; column G-20% risk weight; column H-50% risk weight; column I-100% risk weight; column J-150% risk weight. Assign these exposures to risk-weight categories based on the CRC methodology described above in the General Instructions for Part II. Include the portions of those exposures described above in the instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 8 that are exposures on sovereigns or foreign banks that do not qualify as securitization exposures. [17] Note: These items will become subject to a 250 percent risk weight beginning in 2018.</label>

For retained recourse on small business obligations sold with recourse that qualify as securitization exposures, please see section 42(h) of the regulatory capital rule for purposes of risk weighting and report these exposures in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 10. Under Section 208 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, a "qualifying institution" that transfers small business loans and leases on personal property (small business obligations) with recourse in a transaction that qualifies as a sale under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) must maintain risk-based capital only against the amount of recourse retained, provided the institution establishes a recourse liability account that is sufficient under GAAP. Only loans and leases to businesses that meet the criteria for a small business concern established by the Small Business Administration under Section 3(c) of the Small Business Act (12 U.S.C. 631) are eligible for this favorable risk-based capital treatment. In general, a "qualifying institution" is one that is well capitalized without regard to the Section 208 provisions. If a bank ceases to be a qualifying institution or exceeds the retained recourse limit set forth in banking agency regulations implementing Section 208, all new transfers of small business obligations with recourse would not be treated as sales. However, the reporting and risk-based capital treatment described above will continue to apply to any transfers of small business obligations with recourse that were consummated during the time the bank was a "qualifying institution" and did not exceed the limit. * In column B, report 100 percent of the amount reported in column A. * In column C-0% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of the portion of retained recourse on small business obligations sold with recourse reported in Schedule RC-S, Memorandum item 1.b, that are secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the zero percent risk weight. * In column G-20% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of the portion of retained recourse on small business obligations sold with recourse reported in Schedule RC-S, Memorandum item 1.b, that are secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 20 percent risk weight. * In column H-50% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of the portion of retained recourse on small business obligations sold with recourse reported in Schedule RC-S, Memorandum item 1.b, that are secured by collateral or has a guarantee that qualifies for the 50 percent risk weight. * In column I-100% risk weight, include the portion of the credit equivalent amount reported in column B that is not included in columns C through H and J.

For repo-style transactions to which the bank applies the Simple Approach to recognize the risk-mitigating effects of qualifying financial collateral, as outlined in section 37 of the regulatory capital rules, the exposure amount to be reported in column A is the sum of the fair value as of the report date of securities the bank has lent,[20] the amount of cash or the fair value as of the report date of other collateral the bank has posted for securities borrowed, the amount of cash provided to the counterparty for securities purchased under agreements to resell (as reported in Schedule RC, item 3.b), and the fair value as of the report date of securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

Examples: Reporting Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase (Repos) under the Simple Approach for Recognizing the Effects of Collateral Section 37 of the regulatory capital rules provides for the recognition of the risk-mitigating effects of collateral when risk weighting assets collateralized by financial collateral (which is defined in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules). The following examples illustrate the calculation of risk-weighted assets and the reporting of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repos) in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 16, using the Simple Approach. Example 1: Security sold under an agreement to repurchase fully collateralized by cash A bank has transferred an available-for-sale (AFS) debt security to a counterparty in a repo transaction that is accounted for as a secured borrowing on the bank's balance sheet. The bank received $100 in cash from the repo counterparty in this transaction. The amortized cost and the fair value of the AFS debt security are both $100 as of the report date.[21] The debt security is an exposure to a U.S. government-sponsored entity (GSE) that qualifies for a 20 percent risk weight. The repo counterparty is a company that would receive a 100 percent risk weight. Calculation of risk-weighted assets for the transaction: 1. The bank continues to report the AFS GSE debt security as an asset on its balance sheet and to risk weight the security as an on-balance sheet asset at 20 percent:[22] $100 x 20% = $20 2. The bank has a $100 exposure to the repo counterparty (the report date fair value of the security transferred to the counterparty) that is collateralized by the $100 of cash received from the counterparty. The bank risk weights its exposure to the repo counterparty at zero percent in recognition of the cash received in the transaction from the counterparty: $100 x 0% = $0 3. There is no additional exposure to the repo counterparty to risk weight because the exposure to the counterparty is fully collateralized by the cash received. The total risk-weighted assets arising from the transaction: $20 The bank would report the transaction in Schedule RC-R, Part II, as follows: 1. The bank reports the AFS debt security in item 2.b: a. The $100 carrying value (i.e., the fair value) of the AFS debt security on the balance sheet will be reported in column A.[23] b. The $100 exposure amount of the AFS debt security will be reported in column G-20% risk weight (which is the applicable risk weight for a U.S. GSE debt security). 2. The bank reports the repurchase agreement in item 16: a. The bank's $100 exposure to the repo counterparty, which is the fair value of the debt security transferred in the repo transaction, is the exposure amount to be reported in column A. b. The $100 credit equivalent amount of the bank's exposure to the repo counterparty will be reported in column B. c. Because the bank's exposure to the repo counterparty is fully collateralized by the $100 of cash received from the counterparty, the $100 credit equivalent amount of the repurchase agreement will be reported in column C-0% risk weight (which is the applicable risk weight for cash collateral). (Column A) Totals From Schedule RC (Column B) Adjustments (Column C) (Column G) (Column I) Allocation by Risk-Weight Category 0% 20% 100% 2.b. Available-for-sale securities $100 $100 2.b. (Column A) Face, Notional, or Other Amount (Column B) Credit Equivalent Amount (Column C) (Column G) (Column I) Allocation by Risk-Weight Category 0% 20% 100% 16. Repo-style transactions $100 $100 $100 16. Example 2: Security sold under an agreement to repurchase (repo) not fully collateralized by cash A bank has transferred an AFS debt security to a counterparty in a repo transaction that is accounted for as a secured borrowing on the bank's balance sheet. The bank received $98 in cash from the repo counterparty in this transaction. The amortized cost and the fair value of the AFS debt security are both $100 as of the report date.[24] The debt security is an exposure to a U.S. GSE that qualifies for a 20 percent risk weight. The repo counterparty is a company that would receive a 100 percent risk weight. Calculation of risk-weighted assets for the transaction: 1. The bank continues to report the AFS GSE debt security as an asset on its balance sheet and to risk weight the security as an on-balance sheet asset at 20 percent:[25] $100 x 20% = $20 2. The bank has a $100 exposure to the repo counterparty (the report date fair value of the security transferred to the counterparty) of which $98 is collateralized by the cash received from the counterparty. The bank risk weights the portion of its exposure to the repo counterparty that is collateralized by the cash received from the counterparty at zero percent: $98 x 0% = $0 3. The bank risk weights its $2 uncollateralized exposure to the repo counterparty using the risk weight applicable to the counterparty: $2 x 100% = $2 The total risk-weighted assets arising from the transaction: $22 The bank would report the transaction in Schedule RC-R, Part II, as follows: 1. The bank reports the AFS debt security in item 2.b: a. The $100 carrying value (i.e., the fair value) of the AFS debt security on the balance sheet will be reported in column A. b. The $100 exposure amount of the AFS debt security will be reported in column G-20% risk weight (which is the applicable risk weight for a U.S. GSE debt security). 2. The bank reports the repurchase agreement in item 16: a. The bank's $100 exposure to the repo counterparty, which is the fair value of the debt security transferred in the repo transaction, is the exposure amount to be reported in column A. b. The $100 credit equivalent amount of the bank's exposure to the repo counterparty will be reported in column B. c. Because the bank's exposure to the repo counterparty is collateralized by the $98 of cash received from the counterparty, $98 of the $100 credit equivalent amount of the repurchase agreement will be reported in column C-0% risk weight (which is the applicable risk weight for cash collateral). d. The $2 uncollateralized exposure to the repo counterparty will be reported in column I-100% risk weight (which is the applicable risk weight for the repo counterparty). (Column A) Totals From Schedule RC (Column B) Adjustments (Column C) (Column G) (Column I) Allocation by Risk-Weight Category 0% 20% 100% 2.b. Available-for-sale securities $100 $100 2.b. (Column A) Face, Notional, or Other Amount (Column B) Credit Equivalent Amount (Column C) (Column G) (Column I) Allocation by Risk-Weight Category 0% 20% 100% 16. Repo-style transactions $100 $100 $98 $2 16. [19] Although securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reported on the balance sheet (Schedule RC) as assets and liabilities, respectively, they are included with securities lent and securities borrowed and designated as repo-style transactions that are treated collectively as off-balance sheet items under the regulatory capital rules. [20] For held-to-maturity securities that have been lent, the amortized cost of these securities is reported in Schedule RC-L, item 6.a, but the fair value of these securities should be reported as the exposure amount in column A of this item. [21] In both Example 1 and Example 2, because the fair value carrying value of the AFS GSE debt security equals the amortized cost of the debt security, a bank that has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a, does not need to adjust the carrying value (i.e., the fair value) of the debt security to determine the exposure amount of the security. Thus, for a bank that has made the AOCI opt-out election, the carrying value of the AFS debt security equals its exposure amount in Examples 1 and 2. [22] See footnote 21. [23] See footnote 21. [24] See footnote 21. [25] See footnote 21. [26] See footnote 21.</label>

Under the Simple Approach, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of an unused commitment may not be less than 20 percent. * Include in column R the portion of unused commitments secured by the fair value of securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral as determined under the Simple Approach. In addition, the bank must apply the same approach to securitization exposure collateral - either the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach or the Gross-Up Approach - that it applies to determine the risk-weighted asset amounts of its on- and off-balance sheet securitization exposures that are reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 9 and 10. * Report in column S the risk-weighted asset amount of the securitization exposure or mutual fund collateral that collateralizes the portion of unused commitments secured by such collateral. Any remaining portion of the unused commitment that is uncollateralized or collateralized by other qualifying collateral would be reported in columns C through J, as appropriate. For further information, see the discussions of "Treatment of Collateral and Guarantees" and "Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures" in the General Instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II. * Unused commitments with an original maturity of one year or less, excluding ABCP conduits, that must be risk weighted according to the Country Risk Classification (CRC) methodology * In column C-0% risk weight; column G-20% risk weight; column H-50% risk weight; column I-100% risk weight; column J-150% risk weight.

Under the regulatory capital rules, the unused portion of commitments (facilities) which are unconditionally cancelable (without cause) at any time by the bank (to the extent permitted under applicable law) have a zero percent credit conversion factor. The unused portion of such unconditionally cancelable commitments should be excluded from this item and reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 19. For further information, see the instructions for item 19. Also include in column A the unused portion of all revolving underwriting facilities and note issuance facilities, regardless of maturity. In the case of consumer home equity or mortgage lines of credit secured by liens on 1-4 family residential properties, a bank is deemed able to unconditionally cancel the commitment if, at its option, it can prohibit additional extensions of credit, reduce the credit line, and terminate the commitment to the full extent permitted by relevant federal law. Retail credit cards and related plans, including overdraft checking plans and overdraft protection programs, are defined to be short-term commitments that should be converted at zero percent and excluded from this item 18.c if the bank has the unconditional right to cancel the line of credit at any time in accordance with applicable law. For commitments providing for increases in the dollar amount of the commitment, the amount to be converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount and risk weighted is the maximum dollar amount that the bank is obligated to advance at any time during the life of the commitment. This includes seasonal commitments where the dollar amount of the commitment increases during the customer's peak business period. In addition, this risk-based capital treatment applies to long-term commitments that contain short-term options which, for a fee, allow the customer to increase the dollar amount of the commitment. Until the short-term option has expired, the reporting bank must convert and risk weight the amount which it is obligated to lend if the option is exercised. After the expiration of a short term option which has not been exercised, the unused portion of the original amount of the commitment is to be used in the credit conversion process. * In column B, report 50 percent of the amount of unused commitments and the face amount of commercial and similar letters of credit reported in column A.

Include OTC credit derivative contracts held for trading purposes and subject to the market risk capital rule. Do not include centrally cleared derivative contracts. Do not include OTC derivative contracts that meet the definition of a securitization exposure as described in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules; such derivative contracts must be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 10. The credit equivalent amount of an OTC derivative contract to be reported in column B is the sum of its current credit exposure (as reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, Memorandum item 1) plus the potential future exposure over the remaining life of the derivative contract (regardless of its current credit exposure, if any), as described in section 34 of the regulatory capital rules. The current credit exposure of a derivative contract is (1) the fair value of the contract when that fair value is positive and (2) zero when the fair value of the contract is negative or zero. The potential future credit exposure of a contract, which is based on the type of contract and the contract's remaining maturity, is determined by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by the appropriate credit conversion factor from the following chart.

For further information on the treatment of bilateral netting agreements covering derivative contracts, refer to the instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II, Memorandum item 1, and section 34 of the regulatory capital rules. When assigning to OTC derivative exposures to risk-weight categories, banks can recognize the risk-mitigating effects of financial collateral by using either the Simple Approach or the Collateral Haircut Approach, as described in section 37 of the regulatory capital rules. * In column C-0% risk weight, include the credit equivalent amount of OTC derivative contracts with counterparties who meet, or that have guarantees or collateral that meets, the criteria for the zero percent risk weight category as described in the instructions for Risk Weighted Assets and for Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 8, above.

An EBA is managed by another depository institution that has its own account at a Federal Reserve Bank (such as a participant's pass-through correspondent) and acts as an agent on behalf of the participants.  Balances in an EBA represent a liability of a Federal Reserve Bank directly to the EBA participants and not to the agent.  The Federal Reserve Banks pay interest on the average balance in the EBA over a 7 day maintenance period and the agent disburses that interest to each participant in accordance with the instructions of the participant.  Only a participant's excess balances may be placed in an EBA; the account balance cannot be used to satisfy the participant's reserve balance requirement.

The reporting of an EBA by participants and agents differs from the required reporting of a pass-through reserve relationship, which is described in the Glossary entry for "pass-through reserve balances."

A participant's balance in an EBA is to be treated as a claim on a Federal Reserve Bank (not as a claim on the agent) and, as such, should be reported on the balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 1.b, "Interest-bearing balances" due from depository institutions, and, for a participant with foreign offices or with $300 million or more in total assets, in Schedule RC-A, item 4, "Balances due from Federal Reserve Banks."  For risk-based capital purposes, the participant's balance in an EBA is accorded a zero percent risk weight and should be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 1, "Cash and balances due from depository institutions," column C.  A participant should not include its balance in an EBA in Schedule RC, item 3.a, "Federal funds sold."

The balances in an EBA should not be reflected as an asset or a liability on the balance sheet of the depository institution that acts as the agent for the EBA.  Thus, the agent should not include the balances in the EBA in Schedule RC, item 1.b, "Interest-bearing balances" due from depository institutions; Schedule RC, item 13.a.(2), "Interest-bearing" deposits (in domestic offices); Schedule RC A, item 4, "Balances due from Federal Reserve Banks"; or Schedule RC R, Part II, item 1, "Cash and balances due from depository institutions."</label>

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-line-772941_lbl_1936" xml:lang="en">A variable interest entity (VIE), as described in ASC Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation - Overall (formerly FASB Interpretation No.46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," as amended by FASB Statement No. 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)"), is an entity in which equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for that entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or, as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack one or more of the following three characteristics: (a) the power, through voting rights or similar rights, to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, (b) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (c) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity.

Variable interests in a VIE are contractual, ownership, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity's net assets exclusive of variable interests. For example, equity ownership in a VIE would be a variable interest as long as the equity ownership is considered to be at risk of loss.

ASC Subtopic 810-10 provides guidance for determining when a bank or other company must consolidate certain special purposes entities, such as VIEs. Under ASC Subtopic 810-10, a bank must perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it has a controlling financial interest in a VIE. This must include an assessment of the characteristics of the bank's variable interest or interests and other involvements (including involvement of related parties and de facto agents), if any, in the VIE, as well as the involvement of other variable interest holders. The assessment must also consider the entity's purpose and design, including the risks that the entity was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders. In making this assessment, only substantive terms, transactions, and arrangements, whether contractual or noncontractual, are to be considered. Any term, transaction, or arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an entity's status as a VIE, the bank's power over a VIE, or the bank's obligation to absorb losses or its right to receive benefits of the VIE are to be disregarded when applying the provisions of ASC Subtopic 810-10.

If a bank has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and, therefore, must consolidate the VIE. An entity is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE if it has both of the following characteristics:
* The power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.
* The obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity.

If a bank holds a variable interest in a VIE, it must reassess each reporting period to determine whether it is the primary beneficiary. Based on a bank's reassessment it may be required to consolidate or deconsolidate the VIE if a change in the bank's status as the primary beneficiary has occurred.

ASC Subtopic 810-10 provides guidance on the initial measurement of a VIE that the primary beneficiary must consolidate. For example, if the primary beneficiary and the VIE are not under common control, the initial consolidation of a VIE that is a business is a business combination and must be accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (formerly FASB Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations"). If a bank is required to deconsolidate a VIE, it must follow the guidance for deconsolidating subsidiaries in ASC Subtopic 810-10 (formerly FASB Statement No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements").

When a bank is required to consolidate a VIE because it is the primary beneficiary, the standard principles of consolidation apply after initial measurement (see "Rules of Consolidation" in the General Instructions). The assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs should be reported on the Report of Condition balance sheet (Schedule RC) in the balance sheet category appropriate to the asset or liability. An institution that consolidates one or more VIEs must complete Schedule RC-V, Variable Interest Entities, to report, by balance sheet category, (a) the assets of consolidated VIEs that can be used only to settle obligations of the consolidated VIEs and (b) the liabilities of consolidated VIEs for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the reporting institution. Such an institution also must report in Schedule RC-V the total amount of assets and the total amount of liabilities of its consolidated VIEs that do not meet these criteria.</label>

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-RCA_lbl_1952" xml:lang="en">Schedule RC-A is to be completed by banks with foreign offices or with $300 million or more in total assets.

On the FFIEC 031, this schedule has two columns for banks with foreign offices to report detail on "Cash and balances due from depository institutions."  In column A report amounts for the fully consolidated bank, and in column B report amounts for domestic offices only.  See the Glossary entry for "domestic office" for the definition of this term.  Refer to the General Instructions section of this book for a detailed discussion of consolidation.

On the FFIEC 041, this schedule has a single column for banks with $300 million or more in total assets to report detail on "Cash and balances due from depository institutions."

For banks that elect to report balances due from depository institutions at fair value under a fair value option, report the fair value of those balances in the same items and columns as similar balances to which a fair value option has not been applied.

For purposes of these reports, deposit accounts "due from" other depository institutions that are overdrawn are to be reported as other borrowings with a remaining maturity of one year or less in Schedule RC-M, item 5.b.(1), except overdrawn "due from" accounts arising in connection with checks or drafts drawn by the reporting bank and drawn on, or payable at or through, another depository institution either on a zero-balance account or on an account that is not routinely maintained with sufficient balances to cover checks or drafts drawn in the normal course of business during the period until the amount of the checks or drafts is remitted to the other depository institution (in which case, report the funds received or held in connection with such checks or drafts as deposits in Schedule RC-E until the funds are remitted).  For further information, refer to the Glossary entry for "overdraft."

Treatment of reciprocal balances with depository institutions - Reciprocal balances arise when two depository institutions maintain deposit accounts with each other, i.e., when a reporting bank has both a "due from" and a "due to" balance with another depository institution.  Reciprocal balances between the reporting bank and other depository institutions may be reported on a net basis when a right of setoff exists.  Net "due from" balances should be reported in this schedule.  Net "due to" balances should be reported as deposit liabilities in Schedule RC-E.  See the Glossary entry for "offsetting" for the conditions that must be met for a right of setoff to exist.  See also the Glossary entry for "reciprocal balances."

Exclude from this schedule:

(1) All intrabank transactions, i.e., all transactions between any offices of the consolidated bank.

(2) Claims on banks or other depository institutions that the reporting bank holds for trading purposes (report in Schedule RC, item 5, "Trading assets").

(3) Deposit accounts "due to" other depository institutions that are overdrawn (report in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 2, "Loans to depository institutions and acceptances of other banks").

(4) Loans to depository institutions (report in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 2).</label>

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-RCB_lbl_1953" xml:lang="en">This schedule has four columns for information on securities, two columns for held-to-maturity securities and two columns for available-for-sale securities.[1]  Report the amortized cost and fair value of held-to-maturity securities in columns A and B, respectively.  Report the amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt securities in columns C and D, respectively.  Information on equity securities with readily determinable fair values is reported in the columns for available-for-sale securities only (columns C and D).  For these equity securities, historical cost (not amortized cost) is reported in column C and fair value is reported in column D.

Exclude from this schedule all securities held for trading and securities the bank has elected to report at fair value under a fair value option even if bank management did not acquire the securities principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Securities held for trading and securities reported under a fair value option are to be reported in Schedule RC, item 5, "Trading assets," and, for certain banks, in Schedule RC-D - Trading Assets and Liabilities.  Trading assets and securities reported under a fair value option are also reported in Schedule RC-Q - Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value.

In general, amortized cost is the purchase price of a debt security adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount if the debt security was purchased at other than par or face value. (See the Glossary entry for "premiums and discounts.")  As defined in FASB Statement No. 115, fair value is "[t]he amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.  Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and should be used as the basis for the measurement, if available.  . . . If a quoted market price is not available, the estimate of fair value should be based on the best information available in the circumstances.  The estimate of fair value should consider prices for similar assets and the results of valuation techniques to the extent available in the circumstances."  When FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, takes effect, the definition of fair value in Statement No. 115 will be superseded by the definition in Statement No. 157.  For further information, see the Glossary entry for "fair value."

The preferred method for reporting purchases and sales of securities is as of trade date.  However, settlement date accounting is acceptable if the reported amounts would not be materially different.  (See the Glossary entry for "trade date and settlement date accounting.")

For purposes of this schedule, the following events and transactions involving securities should be reported in the manner indicated below:

(1) Purchases of securities under agreements to resell and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase - These transactions are not to be treated as purchases or sales of securities but as lending or borrowing (i.e., financing) transactions collateralized by these securities if the agreements meet the criteria for a borrowing set forth in FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.  For further information, see the Glossary entries for "transfers of financial assets" and "repurchase/resale agreements."

(2) Purchases and sales of participations in pools of securities - Similarly, these transactions are not to be treated as purchases or sales of the securities in the pool but as lending or borrowing (i.e., financing) transactions collateralized by the pooled securities if the participation agreements meet the criteria for a borrowing set forth in FASB Statement No. 140.  For further information, see the Glossary entries for "transfers of financial assets" and "repurchase/resale agreements."

(3) Pledged securities - Pledged securities that have not been transferred to the secured party should continue to be included in the pledging bank's holdings of securities that are reported in Schedule RC-B.  If the bank has transferred pledged securities to the secured party, the bank should account for the pledged securities in accordance with FASB Statement No. 140.

(4) Securities borrowed and lent - Securities borrowed and lent shall be reported on the balance sheet of either the borrowing or lending bank in accordance with FASB Statement No. 140.  For further information, see the Glossary entries for "transfers of financial assets" and "securities borrowing/lending transactions."

(5) Short sales of securities - Such transactions are to be reported as described in the Glossary entry for "short position."

(6) Futures, forward, and option contracts - Such open contracts to buy or sell securities in the future are to be reported as derivatives in Schedule RC-L, item 12.


[1]  Available-for-sale securities are generally reported in Schedule RC-B, columns C and D.  However, a bank may have certain assets that fall within the definition of "securities" in FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, (e.g., certain industrial development obligations) that the bank has designated as "available-for-sale" which are reported for purposes of the Report of Condition in a balance sheet category other than "Securities" (e.g., "Loans and lease financing receivables").</label>

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-RCCI_lbl_1954" xml:lang="en">Loans and lease financing receivables are extensions of credit resulting from either direct negotiation between the bank and its customers or the purchase of such assets from others.  See the Glossary entries for "loan" and for "lease accounting" for further information.

Report all loans and leases that the bank has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, i.e., loans and leases held for investment, in Schedule RC-C, part I.  Also report in Schedule RC-C, part I, all loans and leases held for sale as part of the consolidated bank's mortgage banking activities or activities of a similar nature involving other types of loans.  Include the fair value of all loans held for investment and all loans held for sale that the bank has elected to report at fair value under a fair value option.  Loans reported at fair value in Schedule RC-C, part I, should include only the fair value of the funded portion of the loan.  If the unfunded portion of the loan, if any, is reported at fair value, this fair value should be reported as an "Other asset" or an "Other liability," as appropriate, in Schedule RC, item 11 or item 20, respectively.

Exclude from Schedule RC-C, part I, all loans and leases classified as trading (report in Schedule RC, item 5, "Trading assets," and, in the appropriate items of Schedule RC-D, Trading Assets and Liabilities, and Schedule RC-Q, Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value, if applicable). 

When a loan is acquired (through origination or purchase) with the intent or expectation that it may or will be sold at some indefinite date in the future, the loan should be reported as held for sale or held for investment, based on facts and circumstances, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and related supervisory guidance.  In addition, a loan acquired and held for securitization purposes should be reported as a loan held for sale, provided the securitization transaction will be accounted for as a sale under FASB Statement No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities."  Notwithstanding the above, banks may classify loans as trading if the bank applies fair value accounting, with changes in fair value reported in current earnings, and manages these assets and liabilities as trading positions, subject to the controls and applicable regulatory guidance related to trading activities.  For example, a bank would generally not classify a loan that meets these criteria as a trading asset unless the bank holds the loan for one of the following purposes:  (a) for market making activities, including such activities as accumulating loans for sale or securitization; (b) to benefit from actual or expected price movements; or (c) to lock in arbitrage profits.  

Loans held for sale (not classified as trading in accordance with the preceding instruction) shall be reported in Schedule RC-C, part I, at the lower of cost or fair value as of the report date, except for those that the bank has elected to account for at fair value under a fair value option.  For loans held for sale that are reported at the lower of cost or fair value, the amount by which cost exceeds fair value, if any, shall be accounted for as a valuation allowance.  For further information, see FASB Statement No. 65, "Accounting for Certain Mortgage Banking Activities," AICPA Statement of Position 01-6, "Accounting by Certain Entities (Including Entities With Trade Receivables) That Lend to or Finance the Activities of Others," and the March 26, 2001, Interagency Guidance on Certain Loans Held for Sale.

On the FFIEC 041, Schedule RC-C, part I, has two columns for information on loans and leases: column B is to be completed by all banks and column A is to be completed by banks with $300 million or more in total assets.  On the FFIEC 031, this schedule has two columns:  column A provides loan and lease detail for the fully consolidated bank and column B provides detail on loans and leases held by the domestic offices of the reporting bank.  (See the Glossary entry for "domestic office" for the definition of this term.)

Report loans and leases held for investment in this schedule without any deduction for loss allowances for loans and leases or allocated transfer risk reserves related to loans and leases, which are to be reported in Schedule RC, item 4.c, "Allowance for loan and lease losses."  Each item in this schedule should be reported net of (1) unearned income (to the extent possible) and (2) deposits accumulated for the payment of personal loans (hypothecated deposits).  Net unamortized loan fees represent an adjustment of the loan yield, and shall be reported in this schedule in the same manner as unearned income on loans, i.e., deducted from the related loan balances (to the extent possible) or deducted from total loans in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 11, "LESS: Any unearned income on loans reflected in items 1-9 above."  Net unamortized direct loan origination costs shall be added to the related loan balances in each item in this schedule.  (See the Glossary entry for "loan fees" for further information.)

"Purchased impaired loans" are loans accounted for in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 03-3, "Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer," that a bank has purchased, including those acquired in a purchase business combination, where there is evidence of deterioration of credit quality since the origination of the loan and it is probable, at the purchase date, that the bank will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable.  Neither the accretable yield nor the nonaccretable difference associated with purchased impaired loans should be reported as unearned income in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 11.  In addition, the nonaccretable difference, must not be recognized as an adjustment of yield, loss accrual, or valuation allowance.

If, as a result of a change in circumstances, the bank regains control of a loan previously accounted for appropriately as having been sold because one or more of the conditions for sale accounting in FASB Statement No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," are no longer met, such a change should be accounted for in the same manner as a purchase of the loan from the former transferee (purchaser) in exchange for liabilities assumed.  The rebooked loan must be reported as a loan asset in Schedule RC-C, part I, either as a loan held for sale or a loan held for investment, based on facts and circumstances, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  This accounting and reporting treatment applies, for example, to U.S. Government-guaranteed or -insured residential mortgage loans backing Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) mortgage-backed securities that a bank services after it has securitized the loans in a transfer accounted for as a sale.  If and when individual loans later meet delinquency criteria specified by GNMA, the loans are eligible for repurchase, the bank is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans, and the delinquent loans must be brought back onto the bank's books as loan assets. 

All loans should be categorized in Schedule RC-C, part I, according to security, borrower, or purpose. Loans covering two or more categories are sometimes difficult to categorize.  In such instances, categorize the entire loan according to the major criterion.

Report in Schedule RC-C, part I, all loans and leases on the books of the reporting bank even if on the report date they are past due and collection is doubtful.  Exclude any loans or leases the bank has sold or charged off.  Also exclude assets received in full or partial satisfaction of a loan or lease (unless the asset received is itself reportable as a loan or lease) and any loans for which the bank has obtained physical possession of the underlying collateral, regardless of whether formal foreclosure or repossession proceedings have been instituted against the borrower.  Refer to the Glossary entries for "troubled debt restructurings" and "foreclosed assets" for further discussion of these topics.

Exclude, for purposes of this schedule, the following:

(1) Federal funds sold (in domestic offices), i.e., all loans of immediately available funds (in domestic offices) that mature in one business day or roll over under a continuing contract, excluding funds lent in the form of securities purchased under agreements to resell.  Report federal funds sold (in domestic offices) in Schedule RC, item 3.a.  However, report overnight lending for commercial and industrial purposes as loans in this schedule.  On the FFIEC 031, also report lending transactions in foreign offices involving immediately available funds with an original maturity of one business day or under a continuing contract that are not securities resale agreements as loans in this schedule.

(2) Lending transactions in the form of securities purchased under agreements to resell (report in Schedule RC, item 3.b, "Securities purchased under agreements to resell").

(3) All holdings of commercial paper (report in Schedule RC, item 5, if held for trading; report in Schedule RC-B, item 4.b, "Other mortgage-backed securities," item 5, "Asset-backed securities," or item 6, "Other debt securities," as appropriate, if held for purposes other than trading).

(4) Contracts of sale or other loans indirectly representing other real estate (report in Schedule RC, item 7, "Other real estate owned").

(5) Undisbursed loan funds, sometimes referred to as incomplete loans or loans in process, unless the borrower is liable for and pays the interest thereon.  If interest is being paid by the borrower on the undisbursed proceeds, the amount of such undisbursed funds should be included in both loans and deposits.  (Do not include loan commitments that have not yet been taken down, even if fees have been paid; see Schedule RC-L, item 1.)</label>

Schedule RC-C, part II, requests information on the number and amount currently outstanding of "loans to small businesses" and "loans to small farms," as defined below.  This information is being collected pursuant to Section 122 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991.

For purposes of this schedule, "loans to small businesses" consist of the following:

(1)  Loans with original amounts of $1 million or less that have been reported as "Loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties" (in domestic offices) in Schedule RC-C, part I, items 1.e.(1) and 1.e.(2), column B, and 

(2)  Loans with original amounts of $1 million or less that have been reported in Schedule RC-C, part I:  

*  On the FFIEC 041 for banks with less than $300 million in total assets, item 4, column B, "Commercial and industrial loans;" 

*  On the FFIEC 041 for banks with $300 million or more in total assets, item 4.a, "Commercial and industrial loans to U.S. addressees;" and 

*  On the FFIEC 031, item 4.a, column B, "Commercial and industrial loans to U.S. addressees" in domestic offices.

For purposes of this schedule, "loans to small farms" consist of the following:

(1)  Loans with original amounts of $500,000 or less that have been reported in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.b, column B, "Loans secured by farmland (including farm residential and other improvements)" (in domestic offices), and 

(2)  Loans with original amounts of $500,000 or less that have been reported in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 3, column B, "Loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers" (in domestic offices).

The following guidelines should be used to determine the "original amount" of a loan:

(1)  For loans drawn down under lines of credit or loan commitments, the "original amount" of the loan is the size of the line of credit or loan commitment when the line of credit or loan commitment was most recently approved, extended, or renewed prior to the report date.  However, if the amount currently outstanding as of the report date exceeds this size, the "original amount" is the amount currently outstanding on the report date.

(2)  For loan participations and syndications, the "original amount" of the loan participation or syndication is the entire amount of the credit originated by the lead lender.

(3)  For all other loans, the "original amount" is the total amount of the loan at origination or the amount currently outstanding as of the report date, whichever is larger.

The "amount currently outstanding" for a loan is its carrying value, i.e., the amount at which the loan is reported in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.b, 1.e.(1), 1.e.(2), 3, 4, or 4.a.

Except as noted below for "corporate" or "business" credit card programs, when determining "original amounts" and reporting the number and amount currently outstanding for a category of loans in this part II, multiple loans to one borrower should be combined and reported on an aggregate basis rather than as separate individual loans to the extent that the loan systems in which the bank's business and/or farm loan data are maintained can provide aggregate individual borrower data without undue cost to the reporting institution.  However, if the burden of such aggregation would be excessive, the institution may report multiple loans to one borrower as separate individual loans.

A bank that offers "corporate" or "business" credit card programs under which credit cards are issued to one or more of a company's employees for business-related use should treat each company's program as a single extension of credit to that company.  The credit limits for all of the individual credit cards issued to the company's employees should be totaled and this total should be treated as the "original amount" of the "corporate" or "business" credit card program established for this company.  The company's program should be reported as one loan and the amount currently outstanding would be the sum of the credit card balances as of the June 30 report date on each of the individual credit cards issued to the company's employees.  However, when aggregated data for each individual company in a "corporate" or "business" credit card program are not readily determinable from the bank's credit card records, the bank should develop reasonable estimates of the number of "corporate" or "business" credit card programs in existence as of the June 30 report date, the "original amounts" of these programs, and the "amounts currently outstanding" for these programs and should then report information about these programs on the basis of its reasonable estimates.  In no case should the individual credit cards issued to a company's employees under a "corporate" or "business" credit card program be reported as separate individual loans to small businesses.

Examples of Reporting in Schedule RC-C, Part II

(1)  A bank has a "Loan secured by owner-occupied nonfarm nonresidential property" which has a carrying value on the June 30 report date of $70,000 and this amount is included in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.e.(1), column B.  The bank made this loan to the borrower in the original amount of $75,000, so it would be considered a "loan to a small business" and would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II.  Because the original amount of the loan is $100,000 or less, the bank would report the $70,000 amount currently outstanding in part II, item 3.a, column B.

(2)  The bank has a second "Loan secured by owner-occupied nonfarm nonresidential property" which has a carrying value on the June 30 report date of $60,000 and this amount is included in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.e.(1), column B.  The bank made this loan to the borrower in the original amount of $125,000, so it would be considered a "loan to a small business" and would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II. Because the original amount of the loan falls within the more than $100,000 through $250,000 range, the bank would report the $60,000 amount currently outstanding in part II, item 3.b, column B.

(3)  The bank has a "Commercial and industrial loan" (to a U.S. addressee in a domestic office) which has a carrying value on the June 30 report date of $200,000 and this amount is included in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 4 or 4.a, as appropriate.  The bank made this loan to the borrower in the original amount of $250,000, so it would be considered a "loan to a small business" and would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II.  Because the original amount of the loan is exactly $250,000 which is the upper end of the more than $100,000 through $250,000 range, the bank would report the $200,000 amount currently outstanding in part II, item 4.b, column B.

(4)  The bank has a second "Commercial and industrial loan" (to a U.S. addressee in a domestic office) which has a carrying value on the June 30 report date of $90,000 and this amount is included in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 4 or 4.a, as appropriate.  The bank made this loan to the borrower in the original amount of $500,000 and sold loan participations for $400,000 while retaining $100,000. Nevertheless, based on the entire amount of the credit that was originated by the bank, the loan would be considered a "loan to a small business" and would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II. Because the original amount of the entire loan is $500,000 which falls within the more than $250,000 through $1,000,000 range, the bank would report the $90,000 amount currently outstanding in part II, item 4.c, column B.

(5)  The bank has a third "Commercial and industrial loan" (to a U.S. addressee in a domestic office) which has a carrying value on the June 30 report date of $55,000 and this amount is included in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 4 or 4.a, as appropriate.  This loan represents a participation purchased by the bank from another lender.  The original amount of the entire credit is $750,000 and the bank's original share of this credit was $75,000.  Based on the entire amount of the credit that was originated by the other lender, the loan would be considered a "loan to a small business" and would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II.  Because the original amount of the entire credit is $750,000 which falls within the more than $250,000 through $1,000,000 range, the bank would report the $55,000 amount currently outstanding in part II, item 4.c, column B.

(6)  The bank has another "Commercial and industrial loan" (to a U.S. addressee in a domestic office) and it has a carrying value on the June 30 report date of $120,000.  This amount is included in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 4 or 4.a, as appropriate.  This loan represents a participation purchased by the bank from another lender.  The original amount of the entire credit is $1,250,000 and the bank's original share of this credit was $250,000.  Because the original amount of the entire credit exceeds $1,000,000, the loan would not be considered a "loan to a small business" and would not be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II.

(7)  The bank has a "Loan secured by other nonfarm nonresidential property" and a "Commercial and industrial loan" to the same (U.S. addressee) borrower (in its domestic offices).  The first loan has a carrying value on the June 30 report date of $375,000 and this amount is included in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.e.(2), column B.  This "Loan secured by nonfarm nonresidential property" was made in the original amount of $400,000.  The second loan has a carrying value on the June 30 report date of $650,000 and this amount is included in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 4 or 4.a, as appropriate.  This "Commercial and industrial loan" was made in the original amount of $750,000.

Case I:  The bank's loan system can provide aggregate individual borrower data without undue cost to the reporting institution.  The loan system indicates that this borrower's two loans have a combined original amount of $1,150,000 and therefore the loans would not be considered "loans to a small business" and would not be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II.

Case II:  The bank's loan system cannot provide aggregate individual borrower data without undue cost to the reporting institution.  Therefore, the borrower's two loans would be treated as separate loans for purposes of Schedule RC-C, part II.  Based on its $400,000 original amount, the "Loan secured by other nonfarm nonresidential property" would be considered a "loan to a small business" and would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II.  Because the original amount of the loan falls within the more than $250,000 through $1,000,000 range, the bank would report the $375,000 amount currently outstanding in part II, item 3.c, column B, and count this loan as one loan for purposes of part II, item 3.c, column A.  Since the "Commercial and industrial loan" is being handled separately and its original amount is $750,000, it would also be considered a "loan to a small business" and would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II.  Because the original amount of this loan falls within the more than $250,000 through $1,000,000 range, the bank would report the $650,000 amount currently outstanding in part II, item 4.c, column B, and count this loan as one loan for purposes of part II, item 4.c, column A.

(8)  The bank has a "Loan secured by farmland (including farm residential and other improvements)" which has a carrying value on the June 30 report date of $225,000.  The bank made this loan to the borrower in the original amount of $260,000 and the loan is secured by a first lien on the borrower's farmland.  The bank has a second "Loan secured by farmland" to this same borrower and it is secured by a second lien on the borrower's property.  This second lien loan has a carrying value of $50,000 and the original amount of the loan is the same as its carrying value.  The carrying values of both loans (the $225,000 first lien loan and the $50,000 second lien loan) are included in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.b, column B.

Case I:  The bank's loan system can provide aggregate individual borrower data without undue cost to the reporting institution.  The loan system indicates that this borrower's two loans have a combined original amount of $310,000 and therefore the two loans together would be considered a single "loan to a small farm" and would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II.  Because the original amount of the two combined loans falls within the more than $250,000 through $500,000 range, the bank would report the $275,000 combined total of the amounts currently outstanding for the two loans in part II, item 7.c, column B, and count these two loans to the same borrower as one loan for purposes of part II, item 7.c, column A.

Case II:  The bank's loan system cannot provide aggregate individual borrower data without undue cost to the reporting institution.  Therefore, the borrower's two loans would be treated as separate loans for purposes of Schedule RC-C, part II.  Based on its $260,000 original amount, the first lien loan would be considered a "loan to a small farm" and would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II. Because the original amount of the loan falls within the more than $250,000 through $500,000 range, the bank would report the $225,000 amount currently outstanding in part II, item 7.c, column B, and count this loan as one loan for purposes of part II, item 7.c, column A.  Since the second lien loan is being handled separately and its original amount is $50,000, it would also be considered a "loan to a small farm" and would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II.  Because the original amount of this loan is less than $100,000, the bank would report the $50,000 amount currently outstanding in part II, item 7.a, column B, and count this loan as one loan for purposes of part II, item 7.a, column A.

(9)  The bank has one final "Loan secured by farmland" which has a carrying value on the June 30 report date of $5,000 and this amount is included in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.b, column B.  The bank made this loan to the borrower in the original amount of $300,000, so it would be considered a "loan to a small farm" and would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II. Because the original amount of the loan falls within the more than $250,000 through $500,000 range, the bank would report the $5,000 amount currently outstanding in part II, item 7.c, column B.

(10)  The bank has granted a $150,000 line of credit to a farmer that is not secured by real estate.  The farmer has received advances twice under this line of credit and, rather than having signed a single note for the entire $150,000 amount of the line of credit, has signed separate notes for each advance.  One note is in the original amount of $30,000 and the other is in the original amount of $50,000.  The carrying values of the two notes on the June 30 report date are the same as their original amounts and these amounts are included in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 3, column B.  For loans drawn down under lines of credit, the original amount of the loan is the size of the line of credit when it was most recently approved, extended, or renewed prior to the report date.  In this case, the line of credit was most recently approved for $150,000.

Case I:  The bank's loan system can provide aggregate individual borrower data for multiple advances under lines of credit without undue cost to the reporting institution.  Thus, even though a separate note was signed each time the farmer borrowed under the line of credit, the loan system combines all information about the farmer's separate borrowings under the line of credit.  Therefore, the loan system indicates that the farmer has a line of credit for $150,000 and that the amount currently outstanding under the line of credit for the combined carrying values of the two borrowings under the line of credit is $80,000.  Because the line of credit was most recently approved for $150,000, this $150,000 original amount for the line of credit would be considered a "loan to a small farm" that would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II.  Therefore, the original amount of the line of credit falls within the more than $100,000 through $250,000 range and the bank would report the $80,000 combined total of the amounts currently outstanding for the two notes in part II, item 8.b, column B, and count these two notes to the farmer under the line of credit as one loan for purposes of part II, item 8.b, column A.

Case II:  The bank's loan system cannot provide aggregate individual borrower data for lines of credit without undue cost to the reporting institution.  Therefore, the farmer's two notes under the line of credit would be treated as separate loans for purposes of Schedule RC-C, part II.  The original amount of the line of credit is $150,000 and each of the two notes would be considered a "loan to a small farm" that would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II.  Because each of the two notes indicates that it is part of a $150,000 line of credit and the $150,000 original amount of the line of credit falls within the more than $100,000 through $250,000 range, the bank would report both the $30,000 and $50,000 amounts currently outstanding in part II, item 8.b, column B, and count these as two loans for purposes of part II, item 8.b, column A.

(11)  The bank has one other "Loan to finance agricultural production and other loans to a farmer" which has a carrying value on the June 30 report date of $75,000 and this amount is included in Schedule RC C, part I, item 3, column B.  The bank made this loan to the borrower in the original amount of $100,000, so it would be considered a "loan to a small farm" and would be reported in Schedule RC-C, part II.  Because the original amount of the loan is exactly $100,000 which is the upper end of the $100,000 or less range, the bank would report the $75,000 amount currently outstanding in part II, item 8.a, column B.</label>

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-RCD_lbl_1956" xml:lang="en">Schedule RC-D is to be completed by banks that reported a quarterly average for trading assets of $2 million or more in Schedule RC-K, item 7, for any of the four preceding quarterly reports.  However, because banks with domestic offices only and with less than $100 million in total assets do not report a quarterly average for trading assets in Schedule RC-K, item 7, on the FFIEC 041, Schedule RC-D is not applicable to such banks.  Memorandum items 4 through 10 are to be completed by banks that reported a quarterly average for trading assets of $1 billion or more in Schedule RC-K, item 7, for any of the four preceding quarterly reports.

Trading activities typically include (a) regularly underwriting or dealing in securities; interest rate, foreign exchange rate, commodity, equity, and credit derivative contracts; other financial instruments; and other assets for resale, (b) acquiring or taking positions in such items principally for the purpose of selling in the near term or otherwise with the intent to resell in order to profit from short-term price movements, and (c) acquiring or taking positions in such items as an accommodation to customers or for other trading purposes.

Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," all securities within the scope of FASB Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," that a bank has elected to report at fair value under a fair value option with changes in fair value reported in current earnings should be classified as trading securities.  In addition, for purposes of these reports, banks may classify assets (other than securities within the scope of FASB Statement No. 115) and liabilities as trading if the bank applies fair value accounting, with changes in fair value reported in current earnings, and manages these assets and liabilities as trading positions, subject to the controls and applicable regulatory guidance related to trading activities.  For example, a bank would generally not classify a loan to which it has applied the fair value option as a trading asset unless the bank holds the loan, which it manages as a trading position, for one of the following purposes:  (a) for market making activities, including such activities as accumulating loans for sale or securitization; (b) to benefit from actual or expected price movements; or (c) to lock in arbitrage profits.  When reporting loans classified as trading in Schedule RC-D, banks should include only the fair value of the funded portion of the loan in item 6 of this schedule.  If the unfunded portion of the loan, if any, is classified as trading (and does not meet the definition of a derivative), the fair value of the commitment to lend should be reported as an "Other trading asset" or an "Other trading liability," as appropriate, in Schedule RC-D, item 9 or item 13.b, respectively.

Assets, liabilities, and other financial instruments classified as trading shall be consistently valued at fair value.

Exclude from this schedule all available-for-sale securities and all loans and leases that do not satisfy the criteria for classification as trading as described above.  (Also see the Glossary entry for "Trading Account.")  Available-for-sale securities are generally reported in Schedule RC, item 2.b, and in Schedule RC-B, columns C and D.  However, a bank may have certain assets that fall within the definition of "securities" in FASB Statement No. 115 (e.g., nonrated industrial development obligations) that the bank has designated as "available-for-sale" which are reported for purposes of the Report of Condition in a balance sheet category other than "Securities" (e.g., "Loans and lease financing receivables").  Loans and leases that do not satisfy the criteria for the trading account should be reported in Schedule RC, item 4.a or item 4.b, and in Schedule RC-C.

On the FFIEC 031, this schedule has two columns:  column A provides trading asset and liability detail for the fully consolidated bank and column B provides detail on trading assets and liabilities held by the domestic offices of the reporting bank.  (See the Glossary entry for "domestic office" for the definition of this term.)</label>

(7)  overdraft;
(8)  pass-through reserve balances;
(9)  placements and takings; and
(10) reciprocal balances.

On the FFIEC 031 only, Schedule RC-E consists of two parts.  Part I covers the deposit liabilities of the domestic offices of the consolidated bank.  Part II covers the deposit liabilities of the foreign offices (including Edge and Agreement subsidiaries and IBFs) of the consolidated bank.  (See the Glossary entries for "domestic office" and "foreign office" for the definitions of these terms.)

NOTE: For information about the reporting of deposits for deposit insurance and FICO assessment purposes, refer to Schedule RC-O.

NOTE: For the appropriate treatment of deposits of depository institutions for which the reporting bank is serving as a pass-through agent for federal required reserves, see the Glossary entry for "pass-through reserve balances."

NOTE: For banks that elect to report deposits at fair value under a fair value option, report the fair value of those deposits in the same items and columns as similar deposits to which a fair value option has not been applied.  Currently, deposits that include a demand feature (e.g., demand and savings deposits in domestic offices) are not eligible to be reported under a fair value election.


Definitions

The term "deposits" is defined in the Glossary and generally follows the definitions of deposits used in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and in Federal Reserve Regulation D. 

Reciprocal balances between the reporting bank and other depository institutions may be reported on a net basis when a right of setoff exists.  See the Glossary entry for "offsetting" for the conditions that must be met for a right of setoff to exist. 

The following are not reported as deposits in Schedule RC-E: 

(1)	Deposits received in one office of the bank for deposit in another office of the bank. 

(2)	Outstanding drafts (including advices or authorizations to charge the bank's balance in another depository institution) drawn in the regular course of business by the reporting bank on other depository institutions.

(3)	Trust funds held in the bank's own trust department that the bank keeps segregated and apart from its general assets and does not use in the conduct of its business.  NOTE:  Such uninvested trust funds must be reported as deposit liabilities in Schedule RC-O, item 1.

(4)	Deposits accumulated for the payment of personal loans (i.e., hypothecated deposits), which should be netted against loans in Schedule RC-C, Loans and Lease Financing Receivables. 

(5)	All obligations arising from assets sold under agreements to repurchase. 

(6)	Overdrafts in deposit accounts.  Overdrafts are to be reported as loans in Schedule RC-C and not as negative deposits.  Overdrafts in one or more transaction accounts within a group of related transaction accounts of a single type (i.e., demand deposit accounts or NOW accounts, but not a combination thereof) maintained in the same right and capacity by a customer (a single legal entity) that are established under a bona fide cash management arrangement by this customer are not to be classified as loans unless there is a net overdraft position in the group of related transaction accounts taken as a whole.  For reporting and deposit insurance assessment purposes, such accounts function as, and are regarded as, one account rather than multiple separate accounts.  (NOTE:  Affiliates and subsidiaries are considered separate legal entities.)  See the Glossary entry for "cash management arrangements" for information on bona fide cash management arrangements.

(7)	Time deposits sold (issued) by the reporting bank that it has subsequently purchased in the secondary market (typically as a result of the bank's trading activities) and has not resold as of the report date.  For purposes of these reports, a bank that purchases a time deposit it has issued is regarded as having paid the time deposit prior to maturity.  The effect of the transaction is that the bank has cancelled a liability as opposed to having acquired an asset for its portfolio.

The following are reported as deposits: 

(1)	Deposits of trust funds standing to the credit of other banks and all trust funds held or deposited in any department of the reporting bank other than the trust department. 

(2)	Credit items that could not be posted to the individual deposit accounts but that have been credited to the control accounts of the various deposit categories on the general ledger.

(3)	Credit items not yet posted to deposit accounts that are carried in suspense or similar nondeposit accounts and are material in amount.  As described in the Glossary entry for "suspense accounts," the items included in such accounts should be reviewed and material amounts reported in the appropriate balance sheet accounts.  NOTE:  Regardless of whether deposits carried in suspense accounts have been reclassified as deposits and reported in Schedule RC-E, they must be reported as deposit liabilities in Schedule RC-O, items 1 and 4. 

(4)	Escrow funds.

(5)	Payments collected by the bank on loans secured by real estate and other loans serviced for others that have not yet been remitted to the owners of the loans. 

(6)	Credit balances resulting from customers' overpayments of account balances on credit cards and other revolving credit plans.

(7)	Funds received or held in connection with checks or drafts drawn by the reporting bank and drawn on, or payable at or through, another depository institution either on a zero balance account or on an account that is not routinely maintained with sufficient balances to cover checks drawn in the normal course of business (including accounts where funds are remitted by the reporting bank only when it has been advised that the checks or drafts have been presented).

(8)	Funds received or held in connection with traveler's checks and money orders sold (but not drawn) by the reporting bank, until the proceeds of the sale are remitted to another party, and funds received or held in connection with other such checks used (but not drawn) by the reporting bank, until the amount of the checks is remitted to another party.

(9)	Checks drawn by the reporting bank on, or payable at or through, a Federal Reserve Bank or a Federal Home Loan Bank.

(10)	Refundable loan commitment fees received or held by the reporting bank prior to loan closing.

(11)	Refundable stock subscription payments received or held by the reporting bank prior to the issuance of the stock.  (Report nonrefundable stock subscription payments in Schedule RC-G, item 4, "All other liabilities.")

(12)	Improperly executed repurchase agreement sweep accounts (repo sweeps).  According to Section 360.8 of the FDIC's regulations, an "internal sweep account" is "an account held pursuant to a contract between an insured depository institution and its customer involving the pre-arranged, automated transfer of funds from a deposit account to . . . another account or investment vehicle located within the depository institution."  When a repo sweep from a deposit account is improperly executed by an institution, the customer obtains neither an ownership interest in identified assets subject to a repurchase agreement nor a perfected security interest in the applicable assets.  In this situation, the institution should report the swept funds as deposit liabilities, not as repurchase agreements, in the Reports of Condition and Income beginning July 1, 2009.

(13)	The unpaid balance of money received or held by the reporting institution that the reporting institution promises to pay pursuant to an instruction received through the use of a card, or other payment code or access device, issued on a prepaid or prefunded basis.

In addition, the gross amount of debit items ("throw outs," "bookkeepers' cutbacks," or "rejects") that cannot be posted to the individual deposit accounts without creating overdrafts or for some other reason (e.g., stop payment, missing endorsement, post or stale date, or account closed), but which have been charged to the control accounts of the various deposit categories on the general ledger, should be credited to (added back to) the appropriate deposit control totals and reported in Schedule RC-F, item 6, "All other assets."

The Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the resulting revision to Federal Reserve Regulation D, "Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions," established, for purposes of federal reserve requirements on deposit liabilities, a category of deposits designated as "transaction accounts."  The distinction between transaction and nontransaction accounts is discussed in detail in the Glossary entry for "deposits."  NOTE: Money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) are regarded as savings deposits and are specifically excluded from the "transaction account" classification.


Summary of Transaction Account Classifications

(See the Glossary entry for "deposits" for detailed definitions and further information.)

A. Always regarded as transaction accounts:

	1. Demand deposits.

	2. NOW accounts.

	3. ATS accounts.

	4. Accounts (other than savings deposits) from which payments may be made to third parties by means of an automated teller machine (ATM), a remote service unit (RSU), or another electronic device, including by debit card.

	5. Accounts (other than savings deposits) that permit third party payments through use of checks, drafts, negotiable instruments, or other similar instruments.

B. Deposits or accounts that are regarded as transaction accounts if the following specified conditions
exist:

	1. Accounts that otherwise meet the definition of savings deposits but that authorize or permit the depositor to exceed the transfer and withdrawal rules for a savings deposit.

	2. Any deposit or account that otherwise meets the definition of a time deposit but that allows withdrawals within the first six days after the date of deposit and that does not require an early withdrawal penalty of at least seven days' simple interest on amounts withdrawn within those first six days, unless the deposit or account meets the definition of a savings deposit.  Any such deposit or account that meets the definition of a savings deposit shall be reported as a savings deposit, otherwise it shall be reported as a demand deposit, which is a transaction account.

	3. The remaining balance of a time deposit from which a partial early withdrawal is made, unless the remaining balance either (a) is subject to additional early withdrawal penalties of at least seven days' simple interest on amounts withdrawn within six days after each partial withdrawal (in which case the deposit or account continues to be reported as a time deposit) or (b) is placed in an account that meets the definition of a savings deposit (in which case the deposit or account shall be reported as a savings deposit).  Otherwise, the deposit or account shall be reported as a demand deposit, which is a transaction account.

C. Not regarded as transaction accounts (unless specified above):

	1. Savings deposits (including accounts commonly known as money market deposit accounts (MMDAs)).

	2. Accounts that permit telephone or preauthorized transfers or transfers by ATMs or RSUs to repay loans made or serviced by the same depository institution.

	3. Accounts that permit telephone or preauthorized withdrawals where the proceeds are to be mailed to or picked up by the depositor.

	4. Accounts that permit transfers to other accounts of the depositor at the same institution through ATMs or RSUs.

Column Instructions

Deposits as summarized above are divided into two general categories, "Transaction Accounts" (columns A and B) and "Nontransaction Accounts (including MMDAs)" (column C).

Column A - Total transaction accounts.  Report in column A the total of all transaction accounts as summarized above and fully defined in the Glossary entry for "deposits."  With the exceptions noted in the item instructions and the Glossary entry, the term  "transaction account" is defined as a deposit or account from which the depositor or account holder is permitted to make transfers or withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instruments, payment orders of withdrawal, telephone transfers, or other similar devices for the purpose of making third party payments or transfers to third persons or others, or from which the depositor may make third party payments at an automated teller machine (ATM), a remote service unit (RSU), or another electronic device, including by debit card.

Column B - Memo: Total demand deposits.  Report in item 7, column B, the total of all demand deposits, including any matured time or savings deposits without automatic renewal provisions, unless the deposit agreement specifically provides for the funds to be transferred at maturity to another type of account (i.e., other than a demand deposit) (see the Glossary entry for "deposits").

NOTE: Demand deposits are, of course, one type of transaction account.  Therefore, the amount reported in item 7, column B, should be included by category of depositor in the breakdown of transaction accounts by category of depositor that is reported in column A.

Column C - Total nontransaction accounts (including MMDAs).  Report in column C all deposits other than transaction accounts as summarized above and defined in the Glossary entry for "deposits."  Include in column C all interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing savings deposits and time deposits together with all interest paid by crediting savings and time deposit accounts.


Item Instructions

In items 1 through 6 of Schedule RC-E, banks report separate breakdowns of their transaction and nontransaction accounts by category of depositor.  When reporting brokered deposits in these items, the funds should be categorized as deposits of "Individuals, partnerships, and corporations," "States and political subdivisions in the U.S.," or "Commercial banks and other depository institutions in the U.S." based on the beneficial owners of the funds that the broker has placed in the bank.  However, if this information is not readily available to the issuing bank for certain brokered deposits because current deposit insurance rules do not require the deposit broker to provide information routinely on the beneficial owners of the deposits and their account ownership capacity to the bank issuing the deposits, these brokered deposits may be rebuttably presumed to be deposits of "Individuals, partnerships, and corporations" and reported in Schedule RC-E, item 1, below.  For further information, see the Glossary entry for "brokered deposits."</label>

For days that an office of the bank (or any of its consolidated subsidiaries or branches) is closed (e.g., Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays), use the amount outstanding from the previous business day.  An office is considered closed if there are no transactions posted to the general ledger as of that date.

If the bank entered into a business combination which became effective during the calendar quarter and was properly accounted for as a pooling of interests, the quarterly averages should include amounts for the acquired bank or business from the beginning of the calendar quarter.  If the bank entered into a business combination which became effective during the calendar quarter and was properly accounted for as a purchase, the quarterly averages should include amounts for the acquired bank or business from the date of its acquisition through the end of the quarter only.  If the bank was acquired in a transaction which became effective during the calendar quarter and push down accounting was used to account for the acquisition, the quarterly averages for the bank should include only the dollar amounts for the days (or Wednesdays) since the bank's acquisition in the numerator and the number of days (or Wednesdays) since the acquisition in the denominator.  For further information on poolings of interests, purchase acquisitions, and push down accounting, see the Glossary entry for "business combinations."

If the bank began operating during the calendar quarter, the quarterly averages for the bank should include only the dollar amounts for the days (or Wednesdays) since the bank began operating in the numerator and the number of days (or Wednesdays) since the bank began operating in the denominator.

For all banks, the loan categories specified in item 6 of this schedule correspond to the loan category definitions for Schedule RC-C, part I, Loans and Leases.

Report the full recorded investment in assets that are past due or in nonaccrual status, as reported for purposes of Schedule RC, Balance Sheet, not simply the delinquent payments.  Loan amounts should be reported net of unearned income to the extent that they are reported net of unearned income in Schedule RC C.  All lease, debt security, and other asset amounts must be reported net of unearned income.

For report dates through December 31, 2000, the information reported in column A on assets past due 30 through 89 days and still accruing and in all of Memorandum item 1 on restructured loans and leases included in the past due and nonaccrual totals will be treated as confidential on an individual bank basis by the federal bank supervisory agencies.  Beginning with the March 31, 2001, report date, all of the information reported in Schedule RC-N for each bank will be publicly available. 

When a bank services residential mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or guaranteed by the Veterans Administration (VA) that back Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) securities, i.e., "GNMA loans," after it has securitized the loans in a transfer accounted for as a sale, FASB Statement No. 140 requires the bank to bring individual delinquent GNMA loans that it previously accounted for as sold back onto its books as loan assets when, under the GNMA Mortgage-Backed Securities Guide, the loan meets GNMA's specified delinquency criteria and is eligible for repurchase.  This rebooking of GNMA loans is required regardless of whether the bank, as seller-servicer, intends to exercise the repurchase (buy-back) option.  A seller-servicer must report all delinquent rebooked GNMA loans that have been repurchased or are eligible for repurchase as past due in Schedule RC-N in accordance with their contractual repayment terms.  In addition, if a bank services GNMA loans, but was not the transferor of the loans that were securitized, and purchases individual delinquent loans out of the GNMA securitization, the bank must report the purchased loans as past due in Schedule RC-N in accordance with their contractual repayment terms even though the bank was not required to record the delinquent GNMA loans as assets prior to purchasing the loans.  Such delinquent GNMA loans should be reported in items 1.c, 10, and 10.b of Schedule RC-N.

Definitions

Past Due - The past due status of a loan or other asset should be determined in accordance with its contractual repayment terms.  For purposes of this schedule, grace periods allowed by the bank after a loan or other asset technically has become past due but before the imposition of late charges are not to be taken into account in determining past due status.  Furthermore, loans, leases, debt securities, and other assets are to be reported as past due when either interest or principal is unpaid in the following circumstances: 

(1) Closed end installment loans, amortizing loans secured by real estate, and any other loans and lease financing receivables with payments scheduled monthly are to be reported as past due when the borrower is in arrears two or more monthly payments.  (At a bank's option, loans and leases with payments scheduled monthly may be reported as past due when one scheduled payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more.)  Other multipayment obligations with payments scheduled other than monthly are to be reported as past due when one scheduled payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. 

(2) Open end credit such as credit cards, check credit, and other revolving credit plans are to be reported as past due when the customer has not made the minimum payment for two or more billing cycles. 

(3) Single payment and demand notes, debt securities, and other assets providing for the payment of interest at stated intervals are to be reported as past due after one interest payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. 

(4) Single payment notes, debt securities, and other assets providing for the payment of interest at maturity are to be reported as past due after maturity if interest or principal remains unpaid for 30 days or more. 

(5) Unplanned overdrafts are to be reported as past due if the account remains continuously overdrawn for 30 days or more.

For purposes of this schedule, banks should use one of two methods to recognize partial payments on "retail credit," i.e., open-end and closed-end credit extended to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures, including consumer loans and credit cards, and loans to individuals secured by their personal residence, including home equity and home improvement loans.  A payment equivalent to 90 percent or more of the contractual payment may be considered a full payment in computing delinquency.  Alternatively, a bank may aggregate payments and give credit for any partial payment received.  For example, if a regular monthly installment is $300 and the borrower makes payments of only $150 per month for a six-month period, the loan would be $900 ($150 shortage times six payments), or three monthly payments past due.  A bank may use either or both methods for its retail credit, but may not use both methods simultaneously with a single loan. 

Nonaccrual - For purposes of this schedule, an asset is to be reported as being in nonaccrual status if: 

(1)	It is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower,
 
(2)	Payment in full of principal or interest is not expected, or 

(3)	Principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the asset is both well secured and in the process of collection.

An asset is "well secured" if it is secured (1) by collateral in the form of liens on or pledges of real or personal property, including securities, that have a realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt (including accrued interest) in full, or (2) by the guarantee of a financially responsible party.  An asset is "in the process of collection" if collection of the asset is proceeding in due course either (1) through legal action, including judgment enforcement procedures, or, (2) in appropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving legal action which are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status in the near future.

For purposes of applying the third test for nonaccrual status listed above, the date on which an asset reaches nonaccrual status is determined by its contractual terms.  If the principal or interest on an asset becomes due and unpaid for 90 days or more on a date that falls between report dates, the asset should be placed in nonaccrual status as of the date it becomes 90 days past due and it should remain in nonaccrual status until it meets the criteria for restoration to accrual status described below.

In the following situations, an asset need not be placed in nonaccrual status:

(1)	The criteria for accrual of income under the interest method specified in ASC Subtopic 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly AICPA Statement of Position 03-3, "Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer"), are met for a purchased credit-impaired loan, pool of loans, or debt security accounted for in accordance with that Subtopic, regardless of whether the loan, the loans in the pool, or debt security had been maintained in nonaccrual status by its seller.  (For purchased credit-impaired loans with common risk characteristics that are aggregated and accounted for as a pool, the determination of nonaccrual or accrual status should be made at the pool level, not at the individual loan level.)  For further information, see the Glossary entry for "purchased credit-impaired loans and debt securities."

(2)	The asset upon which principal or interest is due and unpaid for 90 days or more is a consumer loan (as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 6, "Loans to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures") or a loan secured by a 1-to-4 family residential property (as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.c, Loans "Secured by 1-4 family residential properties").  Nevertheless, such loans should be subject to other alternative methods of evaluation to assure that the bank's net income is not materially overstated.  To the extent that the bank has elected to carry such a loan in nonaccrual status on its books, the loan must be reported as nonaccrual in this schedule.

As a general rule, a nonaccrual asset may be restored to accrual status when:

(1)	None of its principal and interest is due and unpaid, and the bank expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest; or 

(2)	When it otherwise becomes well secured and in the process of collection.  

For purposes of meeting the first test for restoration to accrual status, the bank must have received repayment of the past due principal and interest unless, as discussed in the Glossary entry for "nonaccrual status": 

(1)	The asset has been formally restructured and qualifies for accrual status;
 
(2)	The asset is a purchased credit-impaired loan, pool of loans, or debt security accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30 and it meets the criteria for accrual of income under the interest method specified in that Subtopic; or  

(3)	The borrower has resumed paying the full amount of the scheduled contractual interest and principal payments on a loan that is past due and in nonaccrual status, even though the loan has not been brought fully current, and certain repayment criteria are met.

For further information, see the Glossary entry for "nonaccrual status."


Restructured - For purposes of this schedule, restructured loans and leases are those loans and leases whose terms have been modified, because of a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower, to provide for a reduction of either interest or principal.  Once an obligation has been restructured because of such credit problems, it continues to be considered restructured until paid in full or, if the obligation yields a market rate, until the year subsequent to the year in which the restructuring takes place.  A loan extended or renewed at a stated interest rate equal to the current interest rate for new debt with similar risk is not considered a restructured loan.  Also, a loan to a purchaser of "other real estate owned" by the reporting bank for the purpose of facilitating the disposal of such real estate is not considered a restructured loan.

For further information, see the Glossary entry for "troubled debt restructurings."

Column Instructions

The columns of Schedule RC-N are mutually exclusive.  Any given loan, lease, debt security, or other asset should be reported in only one of columns A, B, and C.  Information reported for any given derivative contract should be reported in only column A or column B.

Report in columns A and B of Schedule RC-N (except for Memorandum item 6) the recorded investments (not just delinquent payments) in loans, leases, debt securities, and other assets that are past due and upon which the bank continues to accrue interest, as follows: 

(1) In column A, report closed end monthly installment loans, amortizing loans secured by real estate, lease financing receivables, and open end credit in arrears two or three monthly payments; other multipayment obligations with payments scheduled other than monthly when one scheduled payment is due and unpaid for 30 through 89 days; single payment and demand notes, debt securities, and other assets providing for payment of interest at stated intervals after one interest payment is due and unpaid for 30 through 89 days; single payment notes, debt securities, and other assets providing for payment of interest at maturity, on which interest or principal remains unpaid for 30 through 89 days after maturity; unplanned overdrafts, whether or not the bank is accruing interest on them, if the account remains continuously overdrawn for 30 through 89 days.

(2) In column B, report the loans, lease financing receivables, debt securities, and other assets as specified above on which payment is due and unpaid for 90 days or more.

Include in columns A and B, as appropriate (except for Memorandum item 6), all loans, leases, debt securities, and other assets which, subsequent to their restructuring by means of a modification of terms, have become 30 days or more past due and upon which the bank continues to accrue interest.  Exclude from columns A and B all loans, leases, debt securities, and other assets that are in nonaccrual status.

Report in columns A and B of Memorandum item 6 the fair value, if positive, of all interest rate, foreign exchange rate, equity, and commodity and other derivative contracts on which a required payment by the bank's counterparty is due and unpaid for 30 through 89 days and due and unpaid for 90 days or more, respectively.

Report in column C the recorded investments in loans, leases, debt securities, and other assets that are in nonaccrual status.  Include all restructured loans, leases, debt securities, and other assets that are in nonaccrual status.  However, restructured loans, leases, debt securities, and other assets with a zero percent effective interest rate are not to be reported in this column as nonaccrual assets.
 
Item Instructions

The loan and lease category definitions used in Schedule RC-N correspond with the loan and lease category definitions found in Schedule RC-C, part I.  Consistent with Schedule RC-C, part I, the category-by-category breakdown of loans and leases in Schedule RC-N includes (1) loans and leases held for sale and (2) loans and leases that the bank has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff.</label>

Each "large institution" and each "highly complex institution," which generally are FDIC-insured depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total assets, must complete Memorandum items 6 through 12, 13.a, 16, and 18 and, if applicable, Memorandum item 17 each quarter.  In addition, each "large institution" must complete Memorandum items 13.b through 13.h and each "highly complex institution" must complete Memorandum items 14 and 15 each quarter.  The terms "large institution" and "highly complex institution" are more fully described in the General Instructions preceding Memorandum item 6.

Each separately chartered depository institution that is insured by the FDIC has a unique FDIC certificate number.  When one FDIC-insured institution owns another FDIC-insured institution as a subsidiary, the parent institution should complete items 1 through 11 (except item 9.a) and Memorandum items 1 through 5 of Schedule RC-O by accounting for the insured institution subsidiary under the equity method of accounting instead of consolidating it, i.e., on an "unconsolidated single FDIC certificate number basis." Thus, each FDIC-insured institution should report only its own amounts in items 1 through 11 (except item 9.a) and Memorandum items 1 through 5 of Schedule RC-O under its own FDIC certificate number without eliminating the parent and subsidiary institutions' intercompany balances.  (However, an FDIC-insured institution that owns another FDIC-insured institution should complete item 9.a by consolidating its subsidiary institution.)  In contrast, when an FDIC-insured institution has entities other than FDIC-insured institutions that must be consolidated for purposes of Schedule RC, Balance Sheet, the parent institution should complete items 1 through 11 and Memorandum items 1 through 5 of Schedule RC-O on a consolidated basis with respect to these other entities.

"Large institutions" and "highly complex institutions," including those that own another FDIC-insured institution as a subsidiary, should complete Memorandum items 6 through 18, as appropriate, on a fully consolidated basis.  

General Instructions for Schedule RC-O, Memorandum items 6 through 18

Memorandum items 6 through 18 are applicable only to large institutions and/or highly complex institutions as defined below.  Amounts reported in Memorandum items 6 through 9, 14, 15, and 18 will not be made available to the public on an individual institution basis.  Large institutions and highly complex institutions should complete Memorandum items 6 through 18, as appropriate, on a fully consolidated basis.  Thus, when a large institution or highly complex institution owns another FDIC-insured institution as a subsidiary, it should complete Memorandum items 6 through 18, as appropriate, on a fully consolidated basis.

According to Section 327.8(f) of the FDIC's regulations, a large institution is an FDIC-insured bank or savings association that reported total assets of $10 billion or more as of December 31, 2006, that does not meet the definition of a highly complex institution.  After December 31, 2006, if a bank or savings association not previously classified as a large institution reports total assets of $10 billion or more for four consecutive quarters, the bank or savings association will be classified as a large institution beginning the following quarter.  In the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, an FDIC-insured depository institution's total assets are reported in Schedule RC, item 12.

According to Section 327.8(g) of the FDIC's regulations, a highly complex institution is an FDIC-insured bank or savings association (excluding a credit card bank[1]) that:

(1) Has had $50 billion or more in total assets for at least four consecutive quarters that either is controlled by a U.S. parent holding company that has had $500 billion or more in total assets for four consecutive quarters, or is controlled by one or more intermediate U.S. parent holding companies that are controlled by a U.S. holding company that has had $500 billion or more in total assets for four consecutive quarters; or 

(2) Is a processing bank or trust company that has had $10 billion or more in total assets for at least four consecutive quarters.  According to Section 327.8(s) of the FDIC's regulations, a processing bank or trust company is "an institution whose last three years' non-lending interest income, fiduciary revenues, and investment banking fees, combined, exceed 50 percent of total revenues (and its last three years fiduciary revenues are non-zero), and whose total fiduciary assets total $500 billion or more."  

If, after December 31, 2010, a bank or savings association classified as a highly complex institution falls below $50 billion in total assets for four consecutive quarters, or its parent company or companies fall below $500 billion in total assets for four consecutive quarters, or a processing bank or trust company falls below $10 billion in total assets for four consecutive quarters, the FDIC will reclassify the bank or savings association as a large institution or a small institution, as appropriate, beginning the quarter after the fourth consecutive quarter.

Amounts Guaranteed or Insured by the U.S. Government, its Agencies, or its Government-Sponsored Agencies - The instructions for Schedule RC-O, Memorandum items 6, 11, and 16 refer to amounts recoverable from, or guaranteed or insured by, the U.S. government, its agencies, or its government-sponsored agencies under guarantee or insurance provisions.  Examples include guarantees or insurance (or reinsurance) provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Housing Administration, the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Department of Agriculture Rural Development Loan Program, and the Department of Education for individual loans as well as coverage provided by the FDIC under loss-sharing agreements.  For loan securitizations and securities, examples include those guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) as well as SBA Guaranteed Loan Pool Certificates and securities covered by FDIC loss-sharing agreements. However, if an institution holds securities backed by mortgages it has transferred to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac with recourse or other transferor-provided credit enhancements, these securities should not be considered guaranteed to the extent of the institution's maximum contractual credit exposure arising from the credit enhancements.  

Amounts Guaranteed or Insured by the U.S. Government - The instructions for Schedule RC-O, Memorandum items 7 through 10, 13, and 18 refer to the maximum amounts recoverable from the U.S. Government.  Amounts recoverable from the U.S. government do not include amounts recoverable from government-sponsored agencies (also known as government-sponsored enterprises) including the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), the Federal Home Loan Banks, and the Farm Credit System.

NOTE:  Because certain information on coverage under FDIC loss-sharing agreements is reported elsewhere in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, the treatment of FDIC loss-sharing agreements varies in Schedule RC-O, Memorandum items 6 through 9, 10.b, 11, 13, 16, and 18.

Higher-risk Securitizations - For purposes of Schedule RC-O, Memorandum items 7.b, 8.b, and 9.b, higher-risk securitizations are securitizations where more than 50 percent of the assets backing the securitization meet the criteria for "nontraditional 1-4 family residential mortgage loans," "higher-risk consumer loans," or "higher-risk commercial and industrial loans and securities" as those terms are defined in the instructions for Schedule RC-O, Memorandum items 7.a, 8.a, and 9.a, and in Appendix C to Subpart A to Part 327 of the FDIC's regulations.


[1] As defined in Section 327.8(t) of the FDIC's regulations, a credit card bank is "a bank for which credit card receivables plus securitized receivables exceed 50 percent of assets plus securitized receivables."</label>

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-RCP_lbl_1966" xml:lang="en">Schedule RC-P is to be completed by (1) all banks with $1 billion or more in total assets and (2) those banks with less than $1 billion in total assets where any of the following residential mortgage banking activities (in domestic offices) exceeds $10 million for two consecutive quarters:

(a)  Closed-end and open-end first lien and junior lien 1-4 family residential mortgage loan originations and purchases for resale from all sources during a calendar quarter; or
(b)  Closed-end and open-end first lien and junior lien 1-4 family residential mortgage loan sales during a calendar quarter; or
(c)  Closed-end and open-end first lien and junior lien 1-4 family residential mortgage loans held for sale at calendar quarter-end.

For a bank with less than $1 billion in total assets, the bank must complete Schedule RC-P beginning the second quarter in which the $10 million threshold is exceeded and continue to complete the schedule through the end of the calendar year.  Open-end mortgage banking activities should be measured using the "total commitment under the lines of credit" as defined below.  For example, if the bank's closed-end and open-end first and junior lien 1-4 family residential mortgage loan originations and purchases for resale from all sources exceeded $10 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and the bank's sales of such loans exceeded $10 million during the quarter ended September 30. 2008, the bank would be required to complete Schedule RC-P in its September 30 and December 31, 2008, Call Reports.  If its total assets remain less than $1 billion, the level of this bank's mortgage bank activities during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 would determine whether it would need to complete Schedule RC-P each quarter during 2009 beginning March 31, 2009.

For purposes of Schedule RC-P, closed-end 1-4 family residential mortgage loans are defined in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.c.(2), "Closed-end loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties."  All closed-end 1-4 family residential mortgage loans secured by junior (i.e., other than first) liens should be reported as junior liens in Schedule RC-P even if the bank has also originated or purchased a loan secured by a first lien on the same 1-4 family residential property and there are no intervening junior liens.  Open-end 1-4 family residential mortgage loans are defined in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.c.(1), "Revolving, open-end loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties and extended under lines of credit."

For purposes of reporting on open-end loans extended under lines of credit in Schedule RC-P, the "total commitment under the lines of credit" is defined as the total amount of the lines of credit granted to customers at the time the open-end credits were originated.  For retail and wholesale originations of such open-end loans, the "principal amount funded under the lines of credit" is defined as the initial fundings made to customers on newly established lines of credit.  For open-end loans purchased, sold, held for sale, and repurchased or indemnified, the "principal amount funded under the lines of credit" is defined as the principal balance outstanding of loans extended under lines of credit at the transaction date or at quarter-end, as appropriate.

(1) Had total assets of $500 million or more as of the beginning of their fiscal year; or
(2) Had total assets of less than $500 million as of the beginning of their fiscal year and either:
	(a) Have elected to report financial instruments or servicing assets and liabilities at fair value under a fair value option with changes in fair value recognized in earnings, or
	(b) Are required to complete Schedule RC-D, Trading Assets and Liabilities.

Banks should report all assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (i.e., annually or more frequently).

Column Instructions

Column A, Total Fair Value Reported on Schedule RC

Report in Column A the total fair value, as defined by FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (FAS 157), of those assets and liabilities reported on Schedule RC, Balance Sheet, that the bank reports at fair value on a recurring basis.

Columns B through E, Fair Value Measurements and Netting Adjustments

For items reported in Column A, report in Columns C, D, and E the fair value amounts which fall in their entirety in Levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls should be determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Thus, for example, if the fair value of an asset or liability has elements of both Level 2 and Level 3 measurement inputs, report the entire fair value of the asset or liability in Column D or Column E based on the lowest level measurement input with the most significance to the fair value of the asset or liability in its entirety as described in FAS 157. For assets and liabilities that the bank has netted under legally enforceable master netting agreements in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 39, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts," or FASB Interpretation No. 41, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements," report the gross amounts in Columns C, D, and E and the related netting adjustment in Column B. For more information on Level 1, 2, and 3 measurement inputs, see the Glossary entry for "fair value."

Item Instructions

For each item in Schedule RC-Q, the sum of columns C, D, and E less column B must equal column A.</label>

Under the agencies' regulatory capital rules, assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.  The aggregate dollar or exposure amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category.  The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are added together, and generally this sum is the bank's total risk weighted assets which comprises the denominator of the risk-based capital ratio.

The term "exposure" generally refers to loans to, securities issued by, balances due from, accrued interest receivable from, and all other exposures against the various entities with which the reporting bank conducts its business.  Generally, the exposure amount for on-balance sheet assets is the carrying value.  In the case of derivative contracts, the exposure amount, or credit equivalent amount, is the sum of the current credit exposure (fair value of the contract, if positive) and the potential future exposure, subject to any applicable netting agreements.  In the case of most off-balance sheet items, the exposure amount, or credit equivalent amount, is determined by multiplying the face value or notional amount of the off-balance sheet item by a credit conversion factor.  

The revised regulatory capital rules also provide a definition in section 2 for the term "exposure amount."  The definition of exposure amount (discussed further below in these instructions) is used to determine the amount of an exposure that banks will report and risk weight on this schedule. 

Credit Conversion Factors for Off-Balance Sheet Items - A summary of the credit conversion factors (CCFs) follows.  For further information on these factors, refer to the regulatory capital rules. Note that where a bank commits to provide a commitment, the bank may apply the lower of the two applicable CCFs.  Where a bank provides a commitment structured as a syndication or participation, the bank is only required to calculate the exposure amount for its pro rata share. For off-balance sheet items reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 12 to 21, the reporting bank would only be required to report its pro rata share.

Off-balance sheet items subject to a zero percent conversion factor:
(1) Unused portions of commitments that are unconditionally cancelable at any time by the bank.

Off-balance sheet items subject to a 20 percent conversion factor:
(1) Commercial and similar letters of credit with an original maturity of one year or less, including short-term, self-liquidating, trade-related contingent items that arise from the movement of goods.
(2) Commitments with an original maturity of one year or less that are not unconditionally cancelable.

Off-balance sheet items subject to a 50 percent conversion factor: 
(1) Transaction-related contingent items, including performance standby letters of credit, bid bonds, performance bonds, and warranties. 
(2) Commercial and similar letters of credit with an original maturity exceeding one year. 
(3) Commitments with an original maturity exceeding one year that are not unconditionally cancelable by the bank, including underwriting commitments and commercial credit lines. 

Off-balance sheet items subject to a 100 percent conversion factor: 
(1) Financial standby letters of credit.
(2) Repo-style transactions, including off-balance sheet securities lending transactions, off-balance sheet securities borrowing transactions, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

General Instructions for Part II

The instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 23, provide general directions for the allocation of bank balance sheet assets, credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items, and unsettled transactions to the risk weight categories in columns C through Q (and, for items 1 through 11 only, to the items adjusted from the totals reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, column A in column B).  These instructions should provide sufficient guidance for most banks for risk-weighting their balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts.  However, these instructions do not address every type of exposure.  Banks should review the capital regulations of their primary federal supervisory authority for the complete description of capital requirements. 

Exposure Amount Subject to Risk Weighting

In general, banks need to risk weight the exposure amount.  The exposure amount is defined in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules as follows:

(1) For the on-balance sheet component of an exposure,[1] the bank's carrying value of the exposure.

(2) For a security [2] classified as AFS or HTM where the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a, the carrying value of the exposure (including net accrued but uncollected interest and fees)[3] less any net unrealized gains on the exposure plus any net unrealized losses on the exposure included in AOCI. 

(3) For AFS preferred stock classified as an equity security under GAAP where the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a, the carrying value less any net unrealized gains that are reflected in such carrying value, but are excluded from the bank's regulatory capital components.

(4) For the off-balance sheet component of an exposure,[4] the notional amount of the off-balance sheet component multiplied by the appropriate CCF in section 33 of the regulatory capital rules.

(5) For an exposure that is an OTC derivative contract, the exposure amount determined under section 34 of the regulatory capital rules.

(6) For an exposure that is a derivative contract that is a cleared transaction, the exposure amount determined under section 35 of the regulatory capital rules.

(7) For an exposure that is an eligible margin loan or repo-style transaction (including a cleared transaction) for which the bank calculates the exposure amount as provided in section 37, the exposure amount determined under section 37 of the regulatory capital rules. 
Part II.  Risk-Weighted Assets

(8) For an exposure that is a securitization exposure, the exposure amount determined under section 42 of the regulatory capital rules.

As indicated in the definition in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules, carrying value means with respect to an asset, the value of the asset on the balance sheet of the bank determined in accordance with GAAP.

Amounts to Report in Column B

The amount to report in column B will vary depending upon the nature of the particular item.

For items 1 through 8 and 11 of Schedule RC-R, Part II, column B should include the amount of the reporting bank's on-balance sheet assets that are deducted or excluded (not risk weighted) in the determination of risk-weighted assets.  Column B should include assets that are deducted from capital (subject to the transition provisions of the regulatory capital rules, as applicable) such as goodwill; intangibles; gain on sale of securitization exposures; threshold deductions above the 10 percent individual or 15 percent combined limits for (1) deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, (2) mortgage servicing assets (MSAs), net of associated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs), and (3) significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock; and any other assets that must be deducted in accordance with the requirements of a bank's primary federal supervisory authority.  Column B should also include items that are excluded from the calculation of risk-weighted assets, such as the allowance for loan and lease losses, allocated transfer risk reserves, and certain on-balance sheet asset amounts associated with derivative contracts that are included in the calculation of the credit equivalent amounts of the derivative contracts.  In addition, for items 1 through 8 and 11 of Schedule RC-R, Part II, column B should include any difference between the balance sheet amount of an on-balance sheet asset and its exposure amount as described above under "Exposure Amount Subject to Risk Weighting."  Note:  For items 1 through 8 and 11 of Schedule RC-R, Part II, the sum of columns B through R must equal the balance sheet asset amount reported in column A.  

For items 9.a through 9.d of Schedule RC-R, Part II, the amount a reporting bank should report in column B will depend upon the risk weighting approach it uses to risk weight its securitization exposures and whether the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a.  For each of items 9.a through 9.d, the same mathematical relationship described above will hold true, such that the sum of columns B through R must equal the balance sheet asset amount reported in column A.

* If a bank uses the 1,250 percent risk weight approach to risk weight an on-balance sheet securitization exposure, the bank will report in column B the difference between the carrying value of the exposure and the exposure amount that is to be risk weighted.  For example, if a bank has a securitization exposure that is an AFS debt security with a $105 carrying value (i.e., fair value) including a $5 unrealized gain (in other words, a $100 amortized cost), the bank would report the following:

   * If the bank has not made (or cannot make) the AOCI opt-out election, the bank would report zero in item 9.b, column B.  The bank would report the $105 exposure amount to be risk weighted in item 9.b, column Q-1250% risk weight.
   * If the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election, the bank would report any unrealized gain as a positive number in item 9.b, column B, and any unrealized loss as a negative number in item 9.b, column B.  Therefore, in this example, the bank would report $5 in item 9.b, column B.  Because the bank reverses out the unrealized gain for regulatory capital purposes because it has made the AOCI opt-out election, it does not have to risk weight the gain.  (Note: The bank also would report the $100 exposure amount to be risk weighted in item 9.b, column Q-1250% risk weight.)

* If the bank uses the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach (SSFA) or the Gross-Up Approach to risk weight an on-balance sheet securitization exposure, the bank will report in column B the same amount that it reported in column A.  

For item 10 of Schedule RC-R, Part II, the amount a reporting bank should report in column B also will depend upon the risk weighting approach it uses to risk weight its securitization exposures.  If a bank uses the 1,250 percent risk weight approach to risk weight an off-balance sheet securitization exposure, the bank will report in column B any difference between the notional amount of the off-balance sheet securitization exposure that is reported in column A and its exposure amount.  If the bank uses the SSFA or the Gross-Up Approach to risk weight an off-balance sheet securitization exposure, the bank will report in column B the same amount that it reported in column A.  An example is presented in the instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 10.  For item 10 of Schedule RC-R, Part II, the sum of columns B through Q must equal the amount of the off-balance sheet securitization exposures reported in column A.

For items 12 through 21 of Schedule RC-R, Part II, column B should include the credit equivalent amounts of the reporting bank's derivative contracts and off-balance sheet items that are covered by the regulatory capital rules.  For the off-balance sheet items in items 12 through 19, the credit equivalent amount to be reported in column B is calculated by multiplying the face,  notional, or other amount reported in column A by the appropriate CCF.  The credit equivalent amounts in column B are to be allocated to the appropriate risk-weight categories in columns C through J (or to the securitization exposure collateral category in column R, if applicable).  For items 12 through 21 of Schedule RC-R, Part II, the sum of columns C through J (plus column R, if applicable) must equal the credit equivalent amount reported in column B. 

Treatment of Collateral and Guarantees

a. Collateralized Transactions

The rules for recognition of collateral are in section 37 and pertinent definitions in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules.  The regulatory capital rules define qualifying financial collateral as cash on deposit, gold bullion, investment grade long- and short-term debt exposures (that are not resecuritization exposures), publicly 
traded equity securities and convertible bonds, and money market fund or other mutual fund shares with prices that are publicly quoted on a daily basis.

Banks may apply one of two approaches, as outlined in section 37, to recognize the risk-mitigating effects of qualifying financial collateral:

(1)  Simple Approach: can be used for any type of exposure. Under this approach, banks may apply a risk weight to the portion of an exposure that is secured by the fair value of the financial collateral based on the risk weight assigned to the collateral under section 32.  However, under this approach, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of the exposure may not be less than 20 percent, unless one of the following exceptions applies:

   * Zero percent risk weight: May be assigned to an exposure to an OTC derivative contract that is marked-to-market on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin requirement, to the extent that the contract is collateralized to cash on deposit; to the portion of an exposure collateralized by cash on deposit; to the portion of an exposure collateralized by an exposure to a sovereign that qualifies for the zero percent risk weight under section 32 and the bank has discounted the fair value of the collateral by 20 percent.

   * 10 percent risk weight: May be assigned to an exposure to an OTC derivative contract that is marked-to-market on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin requirement, to the extent that the contract is collateralized by an exposure to a sovereign that qualified for a zero percent risk weight under section 32.

(2) Collateral Haircut Approach: can be used only for repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, collateralized derivative transactions, and single-product netting sets of such transactions.  Under this approach, banks would apply either standard supervisory haircuts or own internal estimates for haircuts to the value of the collateral.  See section 37(c) of the regulatory capital rules for a description of the calculation of the exposure amount, standard supervisory market price volatility haircuts, and requirements for using own internal estimates for haircuts.

Banks may use any approach described in section 37 that is valid for a particular type of exposure or transaction; however, they must use the same approach for similar transactions or exposures.

If an exposure is partially secured, that is, the market value (or in cases of using the Collateral Haircut Approach, the adjusted market value) of the financial collateral is less than the face amount of an asset or off-balance sheet exposure, only the portion that is covered by the market value of the collateral is to be reported in the risk-weight category item appropriate to the type of collateral.  The uncovered portion of the exposure continues to be assigned to the initial risk-weight category item appropriate to the exposure.  The face amount of an exposure secured by multiple types of qualifying collateral is to be reported in the risk-weight category items appropriate to the collateral types, apportioned according to the market value of the types of collateral.

Exposures collateralized by deposits at the reporting institution
The portion of any exposure collateralized by deposits at the reporting institution would be eligible for a zero percent risk weight.  The remaining  portion of the exposure that is not collateralized by deposits should be risk-weighted according to the regulatory capital rules.

b. Guarantees and credit derivatives

The rules for recognition of guarantees and credit derivatives are in section 36 and pertinent definitions are in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules.  A bank may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative by substituting the risk weight associated with the protection provider for the risk weight assigned to the exposure.  Please refer to the definitions of eligible guarantee, eligible guarantor, and eligible credit derivative in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules.  Note that in the definition of eligible guarantee, where the definition discusses contingent guarantees, only contingent guarantees of the U.S. government or its agencies are recognized.   

The coverage amount provided by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative will need to be adjusted downward if:

* The residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant is less than that of the hedged exposure (maturity mismatch adjustment), see section 36(c);

* The credit risk mitigant does not include as a credit event a restructuring of the hedged exposure involving forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest, or fees that results in a credit loss event (that is, a charge-off, specific provision, or other similar debit to the profit and loss account), see section 36(d); or

* The credit risk mitigant is denominated in a currency different from that in which the hedged exposure is denominated (currency mismatch adjustment, see section 36(e).

Exposures covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) loss sharing agreements
The portion of any exposure covered by an FDIC loss sharing agreement would be eligible for a 20 percent risk weight.  The remaining uncovered portion of the exposure should be risk weighted according to the regulatory capital rules.

Treatment of Equity Exposures

The treatment of equity exposures are outlined in section 51 through section 53 of the regulatory capital rules.  Banks must use different methodologies to determine risk weighted assets for their equity exposures:
 
* The Simple Risk Weight Approach (SRWA), which must be used for all types of equity exposures that are not equity exposures to an investment fund, and
* Full look-through, simple modified look-through, and alternative modified look-through approaches for equity exposures to investment funds. 

Treatment of stable value protection
The regulatory capital rules define stable value protection (SVP) in section 51(a)(3).

A bank that purchases SVP on an investment in a separate account must treat the portion of the carrying value of the investment attributable to the SVP as an exposure to the provider of the protection.  The remaining portion of the carrying value of the investment must be treated as an equity exposure to an investment fund.

A bank that provides SVP must treat the exposure as an equity derivative with an adjusted carrying value equal to the sum of the on-balance and off-balance sheet adjusted carrying value.

Adjusted carrying value
The adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure is equal to:

* On-balance sheet equity exposure:  The carrying value of the exposure.
* On-balance sheet equity exposure that is classified as AFS where the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election:  The carrying value of the exposure less any net unrealized gains on the exposure that are reflected in the carrying value but excluded from regulatory capital.   
* Off-balance sheet portion of an equity exposure (that is not an equity commitment):  The effective notional principal amount [5] of the exposure minus the adjusted carrying value of the on-balance sheet component of the exposure.

For an equity commitment (a commitment to purchase an equity exposure), the effective notional principal amount must be multiplied by the following CCFs:  20 percent for conditional equity commitments with an original maturity of one year or less, 50 percent for conditional equity commitments with an original maturity of more than one year, and 100 percent for unconditional equity commitments.

Equity exposure risk weighting methodologies
(1) Simple Risk Weight Approach (SWRA):  Must be used for all types of equity exposures that are not equity exposures to an investment fund.  Under this approach, banks must determine the risk weighted asset amount of an individual equity exposure by multiplying (1) the adjusted carrying value of the exposure or (2) the effective portion and ineffective portion of a hedge pair by the lowest possible risk weight below:

* Zero percent risk weight:  An equity exposure to a sovereign, Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, a multilateral development bank (MDB), and any other entity whose credit exposures receive a zero percent risk weight under section 32 of the regulatory capital rules.
 
* 20 percent risk weight:  An equity exposure to a public sector entity (PSE), Federal Home Loan Bank, and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac).

* 100 percent risk weight:  Equity exposures to:
   * Certain qualified community development investments,
   * The effective portion of hedge pairs, and
   * Non-significant equity exposures, to the extent that the aggregated carrying value of the exposures do not exceed 10 percent of total capital.  To utilize this risk weight, the bank must aggregate the following equity exposures: unconsolidated small business investment companies or held through consolidated small business investment companies; publicly traded (including those held through investment funds); and non-publicly traded (including those held through investment funds). 

* 250 percent risk weight:  Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock that are not deducted from capital.  This risk weight takes effect in 2018.  Before 2018, report such significant investments in the 100 percent risk weight category.

* 300 percent risk weight:  Publicly traded equity exposures.

* 400 percent risk weight:  Equity exposures that are not publicly traded.

* 600 percent risk weight: An equity exposure to an investment firm, provided that the investment firm would (1) meet the definition of traditional securitization in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules were it not for the application of paragraph (8) of the definition and (2) has greater than immaterial leverage.

(2) Full look-through approach:  Used only for equity exposures to an investment fund.  Requires a minimum risk weight of 20 percent.  Under this approach, banks calculate the aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the carrying value of the exposures held by the fund as if they were held directly by the bank multiplied by the bank's proportional ownership share of the fund.

(3) Simple modified look-through approach:  Used only for equity exposures to an investment fund. Requires a minimum risk weight of 20 percent.  Under this approach, risk-weighted assets for an equity exposure is equal to the exposure's adjusted carrying value multiplied by the highest risk weight that applies to any exposure the fund is permitted to hold under the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar agreement that defines the funds permissible investments.

(4) Alternative modified look-through approach:  Used only for equity exposures to an investment fund. Requires a minimum risk weight of 20 percent.  Under this approach, banks may assign the adjusted carrying value on a pro rata basis to different risk-weight categories based on the limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments.

Treatment of Sales of 1-4 Family Residential First Mortgage Loans with Credit-Enhancing Representations and Warranties

When a bank transfers mortgage loans with credit-enhancing representations and warranties in a transaction that qualifies for sale accounting under GAAP, the bank will need to report and risk weight those exposures.  The definition of credit-enhancing representations and warranties (CERWs) is found in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules.  Many CERWs should be treated as securitization exposures for purposes of risk weighting.  However, those CERWs that do not qualify as securitization exposures receive a 100 percent CCF as indicated in section 33 of the regulatory capital rules.  For example, if the bank has agreed to repurchase the loans that it has sold, it will generally need to risk weight those loans in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 17, until the warranties expire.  Note that CERWs do not include certain early default clauses and similar warranties that permit the return of, or premium refund clauses covering, 1-4 family residential mortgage loans that qualify for a 50 percent risk weight provided the warranty period does not exceed 120 days from the date of transfer.  

Example:  A bank sells $100 in qualifying 1-4 family residential first mortgage loans and agrees to repurchase them in case of early default for up to 180 days.  This warranty exceeds the 120-day limit, and therefore the full $100 should be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 17, until the warranty expires.

If the bank has made a CERW that is limited or capped (e.g., a warranty to cover first losses on loans up to a set amount that is less than the full loan amount), such warranties are regarded as securitization exposures under the regulatory capital rules as they represent a transaction that has been separated into at least two tranches reflecting different levels of seniority for credit risk.  (Refer to the definitions of securitization exposure, synthetic securitization, traditional securitization, and tranche in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules).  The bank will need to report and risk weight these warranties in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 10, as off-balance sheet securitization exposures.

Example:  A bank sells $100 in qualifying 1-4 family residential first mortgage loans and agrees to compensate the buyer for losses up to $2 if the loans default during the first 12 months.  Twelve months exceeds the 120-day limit and therefore the agreement is a CERW.  The CERW is also a securitization exposure because the $2 is effectively a first loss tranche on a $100 transaction.  

For purposes of reporting this transaction in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 10, the bank should report $100 in column A, an adjustment of $98 in column B, and then $2 in column Q as an exposure amount that is risk weighted by applying a 1,250 percent risk weight (if the bank does not use the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach (SSFA) or the Gross-Up Approach for purposes of risk weighting its securitization exposures).  The bank will not need to report any amount in columns T or U of Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 10, unless it uses the SSFA or Gross-Up approach for calculating the risk-weighted asset amount for this transaction.

If the bank uses either the SSFA or Gross-Up Approach to risk weight the $2 exposure, the bank should report $100 in both column A and column B.  In column T or U, it would report the risk-weighted asset amount calculated by using the SSFA or Gross-Up Approach, respectively.
 
Treatment of Exposures to Sovereign Entities and Foreign Banks

These instructions contain several references to Country Risk Classifications (CRC) used by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  The CRC methodology classifies countries into one of eight risk categories (0-7), with countries assigned to the zero category having the lowest possible risk assessment and countries assigned to the 7 category having the highest possible risk assessment.  The OECD regularly updates CRCs for more than 150 countries and makes the assessments publicly available on its website.[6]  The OECD does not assign a CRC to every country; for example, it does not assign a CRC to a number of major economies; it also does not assign a CRC to many smaller countries.  As such, the table below also provides risk weights for countries with no CRC based on whether or not those particular countries are members of the OECD.  In addition, there is a higher risk weight of 150 percent for any country that has defaulted on its sovereign debt within the past 5 years, regardless of the CRC rating.

Risk weights for reported balance sheet (items 1 through 11) and off-balance sheet (items 12 through 23) exposures are to be assigned based upon the tables below:
 
* Exposures to foreign central governments (including foreign central banks):

	Risk Weight (%)
Home Country CRC	0-1	0
	2	20
	3	50
	4-6	100
	7	150
OECD Member with No CRC	0
Non-OECD Member with No CRC	100
Countries with Sovereign Default in Previous Five Years	150

* Exposures to foreign banks:

	Risk Weight (%)
Home Country CRC	0-1	20
	2	50
	3	100
	4-7	150

	2-3	100
	4-7	150

Non-OECD Member with No CRC	100
Countries with Sovereign Default in Previous Five Years	150

All risk-weight categories pertaining to exposures to central foreign governments:
* All exposures to foreign central governments may be assigned a lower risk weight if the following conditions are met: (1) the exposures are denominated in the particular foreign country's local currency; (2) the bank has at least equivalent liabilities in that currency; and (3) the risk weight is not lower than the risk weight that particular foreign country allows under its jurisdiction to assign to the same exposures to that country.

Summary of Risk Weights for Exposures to Government and Public Sector Entities

The following are some of the most common exposures to government and public sector entities and the risk weights that apply to them:  

Column C - 0% risk weight:	
* All exposures (defined broadly to include securities, loans, and leases) that are direct exposures to, or the portion of exposures that are directly and unconditionally guaranteed by, the U.S. Government or U.S. Government agencies.  This includes the portions of deposits insured by the FDIC or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).
* Exposures that are collateralized by cash on deposit in the reporting bank.
* Exposures that are collateralized by securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, or other sovereign governments that qualify for the zero percent risk weight.  Collateral value must be adjusted under section 37 of the regulatory capital rules.
* Exposures to, and the portions of exposures guaranteed by, the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, or an MDB (as specifically defined in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules).

Column G - 20% risk weight:
* The portion of exposures that are conditionally guaranteed by the U.S. Government or U.S. Government agencies.  This includes exposures, or the portions of exposures, conditionally guaranteed by the FDIC or the NCUA.
* The portion of exposures that are collateralized by cash on deposit in the bank or by securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or U.S. Government agencies that are not included in zero percent column. 
* General obligation exposures to states, municipalities, and other political subdivisions of the United States.
* Exposures to U.S. government-sponsored entities (GSEs) other than equity exposures or preferred stock, and risk sharing securities.

Column H - 50% risk weight:
* Revenue obligation exposures to states, municipalities, and other political subdivisions of the United States.

Column I - 100% risk weight:
* Preferred stock of U.S. GSEs.

Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures

Under the agencies' regulatory capital rules, three separate approaches are available for setting the regulatory capital requirements for securitization exposures, as defined in section 2 of the regulatory capital rules.  Securitization exposures include asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, other positions in securitization transactions, re-securitizations, and structured finance programs[7] (except credit-enhancing interest-only (CEIO) strips).  In general, under each of the three approaches, the risk-based capital requirement for a position in a securitization or structured finance program (hereafter referred to collectively as a securitization) is computed by multiplying the calculated amount of the position by the appropriate risk weight.  The three approaches to determining the proper risk weight for a securitization exposure are the SSFA, the Gross-Up Approach, or the 1,250 Percent Risk Weight Approach.

If a securitization exposure is not an after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from a securitization that requires deduction, or the portion of a CEIO strip that does not constitute an after-tax gain-on-sale,[8] a bank may assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure using the SSFA if certain requirements are met.  If a bank is not subject to Subpart F (the market risk capital rule) of the regulatory capital rules, it may instead choose to assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure using the Gross-Up Approach if certain requirements are met.  However, the bank must apply either the SSFA or the Gross-Up Approach consistently across all of its securitization exposures.  However, if the bank cannot, or chooses not to, apply the SSFA or the Gross-Up Approach to an individual securitization exposure, the bank must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to that exposure.  

Both traditional and synthetic securitizations must meet certain operational requirements before applying either the SSFA or the Gross-Up Approach.  Furthermore, banks must complete certain due diligence requirements and satisfactorily demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the features of the securitization exposure that would materially affect the performance of the exposure.  If these due diligence requirements are not met, the bank must assign the securitization exposure a risk weight of 1,250 percent.  The bank's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization 
exposure and the materiality of the exposure in relation to its capital.  Banks should refer to section 41 of the regulatory capital rules to review the details of these operational and due diligence requirements.

For example, a bank not subject to the market risk capital rule has 12 securitization exposures.  The operational and due diligence requirements have been met for 10 of the exposures, to which the bank applies the Gross-Up Approach.  The bank then assigns a 1,250 percent risk weight to the other two exposures.  Alternatively, the bank could assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to all 12 securitization exposures.

a. Exposure Amount Calculation

The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not an available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security where the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a, a repo-style transaction, an eligible margin loan, an OTC derivative contract, or a cleared transaction is equal to the carrying value of the exposure.

The exposure amount of an off-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not a repo-style transaction, an eligible margin loan, a cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative), an OTC derivative contract (other than a credit derivative), or an exposure to an asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) program is the notional amount of the exposure.

For an off-balance sheet securitization exposure to an asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) program, such as an eligible ABCP liquidity facility, the notional amount may be reduced to the maximum potential amount that the bank could be required to fund given the ABCP program's current underlying assets (calculated without regard to the current credit quality of those assets).  An exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA does not apply is calculated by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 50 percent.  An exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA does apply is calculated by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 100 percent.

The exposure amount of a securitization exposure that is a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) is the exposure amount of the transaction as calculated using the instructions for calculating the exposure amount of OTC derivatives or collateralized transactions outlined in section 34 or section 37 of the regulatory capital rules.

If a bank has multiple securitization exposures that provide duplicative coverage to the underlying exposures of a securitization, the bank is not required to hold duplicative risk-based capital against the overlapping position.  Instead, the bank may apply to the overlapping position the applicable risk-based capital treatment that results in the highest risk-based capital requirement.

If a bank provides support to a securitization in excess of the bank's contractual obligation to provide credit support to the securitization (implicit support) it must include in risk-weighted assets all of the underlying exposures associated with the securitization as if the exposures had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization.

b. Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach

To use the SSFA to determine the risk weight for a securitization exposure, a bank must have data that enables it to accurately assign the parameters.  The data used to assign the parameters must be the most currently available data and no more than 91 calendar days old.  A bank that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.  See the operational requirements outlined in section 43 of the regulatory capital rules for further instructions.

To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure using the SSFA, a bank must have accurate information on the following five inputs to the SSFA calculation:

* Parameter KG is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated.  KG is expressed as a decimal value between zero and 1 (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of KG equal to .08).

* Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures within the securitized pool to the ending balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures, that meet any of the following criteria: (1) 90 days or more past due; (2) subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding; (3) in the process of foreclosure; (4) held as real estate owned; (5) has contractually deferred interest payments for 90 days or more (other than in the case of deferments on federally guaranteed student loans and certain consumer loans deferred according to provisions in the contract); or (6) is in default. Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.  

* Parameter A is the attachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the exposure.  Parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the exposure of the bank to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures.  Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the bank's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account.  Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.

* Parameter D is the detachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the exposure would result in a total loss of principal.  Parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization exposures that are pari passu with the exposure (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures.  Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.
 
* A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization exposures.

There are three steps to calculating the risk weight for a securitization using the SSFA.  First, a bank must complete the following equations using the previously described parameters:
 
K_(A )=(1-W )*K_G+ ( 0.5 * W)
a= -1/(p * K_A )
u=D- K_A
l=max(A- K_A,0)
e=2.71828, the base of the natural logarithms

Second, using the variables calculated in first step, find the value of KSSFA using the formula below:

K_SSFA=  (e(a*u)- e(a*l))/a(u-l) 

Third, the risk weight of any particular securitization exposure (expressed as a percent) will be equal to:

K_SSFAx1,250

To determine the risk-based capital requirement under the SSFA, multiply the exposure amount by the higher of either (1) the calculated risk weight or (2) a 20 percent risk weight.

For purposes of reporting in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 9 and 10, a bank would report in column T the risk-weighted asset amount calculated under the SSFA for its securitization exposures. 

c. Gross-Up Approach

A bank that is not subject to the market risk capital rule (Subpart F) in the regulatory capital rules may apply the Gross-Up Approach instead of the SSFA to determine the risk weight of its securitization exposures, provided that it applies the Gross-Up Approach consistently to all of its securitization exposures.

To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure using the Gross-Up Approach, a bank must calculate the following four inputs:

1) Pro rata share, which is the par value of the bank's securitization exposure as a percent of the par value of the tranche in which the securitization exposure resides.

2) Enhanced amount, which is the par value of the tranches that are more senior to the tranche in which the bank's securitization resides.

3) Exposure amount of the bank's securitization exposure. 

4) Risk weight, which is the weighted-average risk weight of underlying exposures in the securitization pool.

The bank would calculate the credit equivalent amount which is equal to the sum of the exposure amount of the bank's securitization exposure (3) and the pro rata share (1) multiplied by the enhanced amount (2).
 
A bank must assign the higher of the weighted-average risk weight (4) or a 20 percent risk weight to the securitization exposure using the Gross-Up Approach.

To determine the risk-based capital requirement under the gross-up approach, multiply the higher of the two risk weights by the credit equivalent amount. These steps are outlined in the worksheet below:

	Gross-Up Approach Worksheet to Calculate the Capital Charge for a Securitization Exposure that is Not a Senior Exposure[9]

	(a)	Currently outstanding par value of the bank's  non-senior 
		securitization exposure divided by the currently outstanding 
		par value of the entire tranche (e.g., 60%[10])						
	(b)	Currently outstanding par value of the more senior positions in
		the securitization that are supported by the tranche in which the
		bank owns a non-senior securitization exposure					
	(c)	Pro rata share of the more senior positions currently outstanding
		in the securitization that are supported by the bank's
		non-senior securitization exposure:  enter (b) multiplied by (a)			
	(d)	Face amount[11] of the bank's non-senior securitization exposure			
	(e)	Enter the sum of (c) and (d)								
	(f)	Enter the weighted-average risk weight applicable to 
		the assets underlying the securitization						
	(g)	Risk-weighted asset amount of the bank's non-senior securitization exposure:  enter the higher of:	
		(d) multiplied by 20%, or
		(e) multiplied by (f)								
	(h)	Capital charge for the risk-weighted asset amount of the bank's
		non-senior securitization exposure:  enter (g) multiplied by 8%			

For purposes of reporting its non-senior securitization exposures in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 9 and 10, a bank would report in column U the risk-weighted asset amount calculated in line (g) on the Gross Up Approach worksheet.  For a senior securitization exposure, a bank would report in column U the face amount of its exposure [12] multiplied by the weighted-average risk weight of the securitization's underlying exposures, subject to a 20 percent risk-weight floor.

Reporting in Schedule RC-R, Part II, When Using the Gross-Up Approach:

If the bank's non-senior security is an HTM securitization exposure, the amortized cost of this security is included on the Report of Condition balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 2.a, "Held-to-maturity securities," and on the regulatory capital schedule in columns A and B of Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.a, "On balance sheet securitization exposures - Held-to-maturity securities."  The risk-weighted asset amount from line (g) in the Gross-Up Approach Worksheet above is reported in column U of Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.a.  

If the bank's security is an AFS securitization exposure, the fair value of this security is included on the Report of Condition balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 2.b, "Available-for-sale securities," and on the regulatory capital schedule in column A of Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.b, "On-balance sheet securitization exposures - Available-for-sale securities."   For further information on the reporting of AFS securitization exposures in column B, refer to the instructions for Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.b, because the amount reported in column B depends on whether the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a.  For non-senior AFS securitization exposures, the risk-weighted asset amount from line (g) in the Gross-Up Approach Worksheet above is reported in column U of Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.b. 

If the bank's subordinated security is a trading securitization exposure, the fair value of this security is included on the Report of Condition balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 5, "Trading assets," and on the regulatory capital schedule in column A of Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.c, "On-balance sheet securitization exposures - Trading assets that receive standardized charges."  A trading security is risk-weighted using its fair value if the bank is not subject to the market risk capital rule.  The risk-weighted asset amount from line (g) in the Gross-Up Approach Worksheet above is reported in column U of Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 9.c.

d. 1,250 Percent Risk Weight Approach 

If the bank cannot, or chooses not to, apply the SSFA or the Gross-Up Approach to the securitization exposure, the bank must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the exposure.

Securitization exposure reporting in Schedule RC-R, Part II

Securitization exposure reporting depends on the methodology the bank will use to risk weight the exposure. 

For example, if a bank plans to apply the 1,250 percent risk weight to its exposures, the amount reported in column Q should match the amount reported in column A (less any adjustments, such as that for an allocated transfer risk reserve (ATRR)).  For any securitization exposure risk weighted using the 1,250 percent risk weight, the sum of columns B and Q should equal column A.

		(Column A)
Totals
	(Column B)
Adjustments to Totals Reported in Column A	(Column Q)	(Column T)	(Column U)	
				Exposure Amount	Total Risk-Weighted Asset Amount by Calculation Methodology	
				1250%	SSFA	Gross-Up	
9.	On-balance sheet securitization exposures						
		RCXX XXXX	RCXX XXXX	RCXX XXXX	RCXX XXXX	RCXX XXXX	
		Held-to-maturity securities	$100	$0	$100	$0	$0	9.a.


If a bank - regardless if it makes the AOCI opt-out election - is applying the SSFA or Gross-Up Approach, the reporting is significantly different due to the fact that the bank reports the risk-weighted assets amount in columns T or U.

In the case where a bank has a securitization exposure with a balance sheet value of $100, it would report $100 in both columns A and B.  If the bank applies the SSFA and calculates a risk-weighted asset exposure of $20 for that securitization, the bank would report $20 in column T.  Since it is using the SSFA for all its securitization exposures, the bank must report $0 in column U.

		(Column A)
Totals
	(Column B)
Adjustments to Totals Reported in Column A	(Column Q)	(Column T)	(Column U)	
				Exposure Amount	Total Risk-Weighted Asset Amount by Calculation Methodology

9.	On-balance sheet securitization exposures						
		RCXX XXXX	RCXX XXXX	RCXX XXXX	RCXX XXXX	RCXX XXXX	
		Held-to-maturity securities	$100	$100	$0	$20	$0	9.a.

A bank, at its discretion, could also use both the 1,250 percent risk weight for some securitization exposures and either the SSFA or Gross-Up Approach for other securitization exposures.  For example, Bank Z has three securitization exposures, each valued at $100 on the balance sheet.  Bank Z chooses to apply the 1,250 percent risk weight to one exposure and use the Gross-Up Approach to calculate risk-weighted assets for the other two exposures.  Assume that the risk-weighted asset amount under the Gross-Up Approach is $20 for each exposure.

The bank would report the following:

		(Column A)
Totals
	(Column B)
Adjustments to Totals Reported in Column A	(Column Q)	(Column T)	(Column U)	
				Exposure Amount	Total Risk-Weighted Asset Amount by Calculation Methodology	
				1250%	SSFA	Gross-Up	
9.	On-balance sheet securitization exposures						
		RCXX XXXX	RCXX XXXX	RCXX XXXX	RCXX XXXX	RCXX XXXX	
		Held-to-maturity securities	$300	$200	$100	$0	$40	9.a.

The $200 reported under column B reflects the balance sheet amounts of the two securitizations risk weighted using the Gross-Up Approach.  This ensures that the sum of columns B and Q continue to equal the amount reported in column A.  The $40 under column U reflects the risk-weighted asset amount of the sum of the two securitization exposures that were risk weighted using the Gross-Up Approach.  This $40 is added to total risk-weighted assets in item 28 of Schedule RC-R, Part II.

Banks That Are Subject to the Market Risk Capital Rule

The banking agencies' regulatory capital rules require all banks with significant market risk to measure their market risk exposure and hold sufficient capital to mitigate this exposure.  In general, a bank is subject to the market risk capital rule if its consolidated trading activity, defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its Call Report for the previous quarter, equals:  (1) 10 percent or more of the bank's total assets as reported in its Call Report for the previous quarter, or (2) $1 billion or more.  However, a bank's primary federal supervisory authority may exempt or include the bank if necessary or appropriate for safe and sound banking practices.

A bank that is subject to the market risk capital rule must hold capital to support its exposure to general market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices and its exposure to specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions. 
 
A covered position is a trading asset or trading liability (whether on- or off-balance sheet), as reported on Schedule RC-D, that is held for any of the following reasons:

(1) For the purpose of short-term resale;
(2) With the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements;
(3) To lock in arbitrage profits; or
(4) To hedge another covered position.

Covered positions include all positions in a bank's trading account and foreign exchange and commodity positions, whether or not in the trading account.  Covered positions generally should not be risk weighted as part of the bank's gross credit risk-weighted assets.  However, foreign exchange positions that are outside of the trading account and all OTC derivatives as well as cleared transactions and unsettled transactions continue to have a counterparty credit risk capital charge.  Those positions are included in both gross risk-weighted assets for credit risk and the bank's covered positions for market risk. 

Additionally, the trading asset or trading liability must be free of any restrictive covenants on its tradability or the bank must be able to hedge the material risk elements of the trading asset or trading liability in a two-way market.  A covered position also includes a foreign exchange or commodity position, regardless of whether the position is a trading asset or trading liability (excluding structural foreign currency positions if supervisory approval has been granted to exclude such positions).

A covered position does not include:

(1) An intangible asset (including any servicing asset);
(2) A hedge of a trading position that is outside the scope of the bank's hedging strategy (required by the market risk capital rule);
(3) Any position that, in form or substance, acts as a liquidity facility that provides support to ABCP;
(4) A credit derivative recognized as a guarantee for risk-weighted asset calculation purposes under the regulatory capital rules for credit risk;
(5) An equity position that is not publicly traded (other than a derivative that references a publicly traded equity);
(6) A position held with the intent to securitize; or
(7) A direct real estate holding.

A bank subject to the market risk capital rule must maintain an overall minimum 8.0 percent ratio of total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, net of all deductions) to the sum of risk-weighted assets and market risk-weighted assets.  Banks should refer to the regulatory capital rules of their primary federal supervisory authority for specific instructions on the calculation of the measure for market risk.

Adjustments for Financial Subsidiaries

Section 121 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allows national banks and insured state banks to establish entities known as financial subsidiaries.  (Savings associations are not authorized under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to have financial subsidiaries.)  One of the statutory requirements for establishing a financial subsidiary is that a national bank or insured state bank must deduct any investment in a financial subsidiary from the bank's assets and tangible equity.  Therefore, under the revised regulatory capital rules, a bank must deduct the aggregate amount of its outstanding equity investment in a financial subsidiary, including the retained earnings of the subsidiary, from its common equity tier 1 capital elements in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 10.b.  In addition, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary may not be consolidated with those of the parent bank for regulatory capital purposes.

If a financial subsidiary has not been consolidated into the bank for purposes of the bank's balance sheet, as reported in Schedule RC, the bank must adjust its assets, as reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, for its equity investment in the financial subsidiary (accounted for under the equity method of accounting).  Accordingly, the amount at which the bank's equity investment in the financial subsidiary is included in the bank's "All other assets" as reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 8, column A, should be reported as an adjustment in item 8, column B.  

If a financial subsidiary has been consolidated into the bank for purposes of the bank's balance sheet, as reported in Schedule RC, the bank must adjust its consolidated assets, as reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 9, column A, for the assets of the financial subsidiary that are included in column A.  Accordingly, the amount at which the financial subsidiary's assets are included in the bank's consolidated assets in column A should be reported, by balance sheet asset category, as adjustments in column B.  For example, if a bank's $100 million in HTM securities, as reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.a, column A, includes its financial subsidiary's $10 million in HTM securities, the bank should report $10 million as an adjustment in item 2.a, column B.  

In addition, if a financial subsidiary has been consolidated into the bank for purposes of the bank's off-balance sheet securitization exposures, derivatives, off-balance sheet items, and other items subject to risk weighting as reported in Schedules RC-L, RC-S, and RC, the bank must adjust its consolidated exposures for the exposures of its financial subsidiary when the bank completes the items for derivatives, off-balance sheet exposures, and other items subject to risk weighting in Schedule RC-R, Part II.  Thus, the bank should exclude the off-balance sheet securitization exposures and off-balance sheet items (including repo-style transactions) of its financial subsidiary from the amounts it reports in Schedule RC R, Part II, items 10 and 12 through 19, column A.  The bank also should exclude the derivatives of its financial subsidiary from the calculation of the credit equivalent amount of derivatives the bank reports in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 20 and 21, column B, and from the current credit exposure amount and notional principal amounts reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, Memorandum items 1 through 3.

If a financial subsidiary has been consolidated into the bank for purposes of the bank's balance sheet, as reported in Schedule RC, and the bank's consolidated allowance for loan and lease losses or its consolidated allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures includes such an allowance attributable to the financial subsidiary, the bank must adjust its consolidated allowances for those attributable to the financial subsidiary.  Accordingly, the bank must exclude the portion of its consolidated allowance for loan and lease losses and its consolidated allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures attributable to its financial subsidiary when the bank determines the 
amount of its allowance for loan and lease losses includable in tier 2 capital (reported in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 30.a) and its excess allowance for loan and lease losses (reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 29). 

Treatment of Embedded Derivatives 

If a bank has a hybrid contract containing an embedded derivative that must be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended), then the host contract and embedded derivative should be treated separately for risk-based capital purposes.  When the fair value of the embedded derivative has been reported as part of the bank's assets on Schedule RC - Balance Sheet, that fair value (whether positive or negative) should be reported (as a positive or negative number) in column B of the corresponding asset category item in Schedule RC-R, Part II (items 1 to 11).  The host contract, if an asset, should be risk weighted according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.  All derivative exposures should be risk weighted in the derivative items of Schedule RC-R, Part II, as appropriate (items 20 or 21).
 
Treatment of FDIC Loss-Sharing Agreements

Loss-sharing agreements entered into by the FDIC with acquirers of assets from failed institutions are considered conditional guarantees for risk-based capital purposes due to contractual conditions that acquirers must meet.  The guaranteed portion of assets subject to a loss-sharing agreement may be assigned a 20 percent risk weight.  Because the structural arrangements for these agreements vary depending on the specific terms of each agreement, institutions should consult with their primary federal regulator to determine the appropriate risk-based capital treatment for specific loss-sharing agreements. 

Allocated Transfer Risk Reserve (ATRR)

If the reporting bank is required to establish and maintain an ATRR as specified in Section 905(a) of the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983, the ATRR should be reported in Schedule RC R, Part II, item 30.  The ATRR is not eligible for inclusion in either tier 1 or tier 2 capital.

Any ATRR related to loans and leases held for investment is included on the balance sheet in Schedule RC, item 4.c., "Allowance for loan and lease losses," and separately disclosed in Schedule RI B, part II, Memorandum item 1.  However, if the bank must maintain an ATRR for any asset other than a loan or lease held for investment, the balance sheet category for that asset should be reported net of the ATRR on Schedule RC.  In this situation, the ATRR should be reported as a negative number (i.e., with a minus (-) sign) in column B, "Adjustments to totals reported in Column A," of the corresponding asset category in Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 1 through 4 and 7 through 9.  The amount to be risk weighted for this asset in columns C through Q, as appropriate, would be its net carrying value plus the ATRR.  For example, a bank has an HTM security issued by a foreign commercial company against which it has established an ATRR of $20.  The security, net of the ATRR, is included in Schedule RC, item 2.a, "Held-to-maturity securities," at $80.  The security should be included in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 2.a, column A, at $80.  The bank should include $-20 in Schedule RC-R, item 2.a, column B, and $100 in item 2.a, column I.

Derivatives, Off-Balance Sheet Items, and Other Items Subject to Risk Weighting (Excluding Securitization Exposures)

Treatment of Liquidity Facilities for Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) Programs - Banks that provide liquidity facilities to ABCP programs, whether or not they are the program sponsor, must report these facilities in the following manner in Schedule RC-R (unless the bank is a sponsor and consolidates the sponsored ABCP program assets onto its balance sheet).   The full amount of the unused portion of an eligible liquidity facility with an original maturity exceeding one year to an ABCP facility should be reported in item 18.c, column A.  The full amount of the unused portion of an eligible liquidity facility with an original maturity of one year or less to an ABCP facility should be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 18.b, column A.

Treatment of Derivatives and Off-Balance Sheet Items that are Securitization Exposures - Any derivatives or off-balance sheet items reported in Schedule RC-L or Schedule RC-S that qualify as securitization exposures are to be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 10, column A, and excluded from Schedule RC-R, Part II, items 12 through 21 below.

Repo-style Transactions - The regulatory capital rules permit some repo-style transactions to be risk weighted on a netting set basis.  Where netting is permitted, a bank will combine both on-balance and off balance sheet repo-style transactions in order to determine a capital requirement for a netting set to a single counterparty.  In such cases, a bank should combine securities purchased under agreements to resell (i.e., reverse repos) and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (i.e., repos) with off balance sheet repo-style transactions (i.e., securities borrowing and securities lending transactions) in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 16, and report the netting set exposure to each counterparty under the appropriate risk weight column.


[1]  Not including: (1) an available-for-sale (AFS) or held-to-maturity (HTM) security where the bank has made the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a, (2) an over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contract, (3) a repo-style transaction or an eligible margin loan for which the bank determines the exposure amount under section 37 of the regulatory capital rules, (4) a cleared transaction, (5) a default fund contribution, or (6) a securitization exposure.

[2]  Not including: (1) a securitization exposure, (2) an equity exposure, or (3) preferred stock classified as an equity security under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

[3]  Where the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election, accrued but uncollected interest and fees reported in Schedule RC, item 11, "Other assets," associated with AFS or (HTM) debt securities that are not securitization exposures should be reported in Schedule RC-R, Part II, item 8, "All other assets."

[4]  Not including: (1) an OTC derivative contract, (2) a repo-style transaction or an eligible margin loan for which the bank calculates the exposure amount under section 37 of the regulatory capital rules, (3) a cleared transaction, (4) a default fund contribution, or (5) a securitization exposure.

[5]  The regulatory capital rules define the "effective notional principal amount" as an exposure of equivalent size to a hypothetical on-balance sheet position in the underlying equity instrument that would evidence the same change in fair value (measured in dollars) given a small change in the price of the underlying equity instrument.

[6]  See http://www.oecd.org/trade/xcred/crc.htm.

[7]  Structured finance programs include, but are not limited to, collateralized debt obligations.

[8]  Consistent with the regulatory capital rules, a bank must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax  gain-on-sale resulting from a securitization and must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the portion of a CEIO strip that does not constitute an after-tax gain-on-sale.

[9]  A senior securitization exposure means a securitization exposure that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures, without considering amounts due under interest rate or currency contracts, fees or other similar payments due. Time tranching (that is, maturity differences) also is not considered when determining whether a securitization exposure is a senior securitization exposure.

[10]  For example, if the currently outstanding par value of the entire tranche is $100 and the currently outstanding par value of the bank's subordinated security is $60, then the bank would enter 60% in (a).

[11]  For risk-based capital purposes, if the bank has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule RC-R, Part I, item 3.a, the "face amount" of an AFS security and an HTM security is its amortized cost; the "face amount" of a trading security is its fair value.  If the bank has not made or cannot make the AOCI opt-out election, the "face amount" of an HTM security is its amortized cost; the "face amount" of an AFS security or a trading security is its fair value.

Schedule RC-S should be completed on a fully consolidated basis.  Schedule RC-S includes information on 1-4 family residential mortgages and other financial assets serviced for others (in Memorandum items 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c).  Schedule RC-S also includes information on assets that have been securitized or sold and are not reportable on the balance sheet of the Report of Condition, except for credit enhancing interest-only strips (which are reported in item 2.a of this schedule), subordinated securities and other enhancements (which are reported in items 2.b, 2.c, and 9 and Memorandum items 3.a.(1) and (2)), and seller's interests (which are reported in items 6.a and 6.b).

Column Instructions

Column A, 1-4 Family Residential Loans:  1-4 family residential loans are permanent closed-end loans secured by first or junior liens on 1-to-4 family residential properties as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, items 1.c.(2)(a) and 1.c.(2)(b).

Column B, Home Equity Lines:  Home equity lines are revolving, open-end lines of credit secured by 1 to 4 family residential properties as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.c.(1). 
 
Column C, Credit Card Receivables:  Credit card receivables are extensions of credit to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures arising from credit cards as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 6.a.

Column D, Auto Loans:  Auto loans are loans to individuals for the purpose of purchasing private passenger vehicles, including minivans, vans, sport-utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and similar light trucks for personal use, and are a subset of "Other consumer loans," as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 6.c. 

Column E, Other Consumer Loans:  Other consumer loans are loans to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, items 6.b and 6.c, excluding auto loans as described in Column D of this schedule.

Column F, Commercial and Industrial Loans:  Commercial and industrial loans are loans for commercial and industrial purposes to sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, and other business enterprises, whether secured (other than by real estate) or unsecured, single-payment or installment,  as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 4.

Column G, All Other Loans, All Leases, and All Other Assets:  All other loans are loans that cannot properly be reported in Columns A through F of this schedule as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, items 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 2, 3, and 7 through 9.  All leases are all lease financing receivables as defined for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 10.  All other assets are all assets other than loans and leases, e.g., securities. 

For purposes of items 1 through 10 of Schedule RC-S on bank securitization activities and other securitization facilities, information about each separate securitization should be included in only one of the seven columns of this schedule.  The appropriate column for a particular securitization should be based on the predominant type of loan, lease, or other asset included in the securitization and this column should be used consistently over time.  For example, a securitization may include auto loans to individuals and to business enterprises.  If these auto loans are predominantly loans to individuals, all of the requested information about this securitization should be included in Column D, Auto Loans.  
 
Definitions

For purposes of this schedule, the following definitions of terms are applicable.

Recourse or other seller-provided credit enhancement means an arrangement in which the reporting bank retains, in form or in substance, any risk of credit loss directly or indirectly associated with a transferred (sold) asset that exceeds its pro rata claim on the asset.  It also includes a representation or warranty extended by the reporting bank when it transfers an asset, or assumed by the bank when it services a transferred asset, that obligates the bank to absorb credit losses on the transferred asset.  Such an arrangement typically exists when a bank transfers assets and agrees to protect purchasers or some other party, e.g., investors in securitized assets, from losses due to default by or nonperformance of the obligor on the transferred assets or some other party.  The bank provides this protection by retaining:
  
(a) an interest in the transferred assets, e.g., credit-enhancing interest-only strips, "spread" accounts, subordinated interests or securities, collateral invested amounts, and cash collateral accounts, that absorbs losses,  or

(b) an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets 

in the event of a default of principal or interest on the transferred assets or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party.  Subordinated interests and subordinated securities retained by a bank when it securitizes assets expose the bank to more than its pro rata share of loss and thus are considered a form of credit enhancement to the securitization structure.

Credit-enhancing interest-only strip, as defined in the banking agencies' regulatory capital standards, means an on-balance sheet asset that, in form or in substance: (i) represents the contractual right to receive some or all of the interest due on transferred assets; and (ii) exposes the bank to credit risk directly or indirectly associated with the transferred assets that exceeds a pro rata share of the bank's claim on the assets, whether through subordination provisions or other credit enhancement techniques.  Credit-enhancing interest-only strips include other similar "spread" assets and can be either retained or purchased. 

Liquidity facility means any arrangement, including servicer cash advances, in which the reporting bank is obligated to provide funding to a securitization structure to ensure investors of timely payments on issued securities, e.g., by smoothing timing differences in the  receipt of interest and principal payments on the underlying securitized assets, or to ensure investors of payments in the event of market disruptions.  Advances under such a facility are typically reimbursed from subsequent collections by the securitization structure and are not subordinated to other claims on the cash flows from the underlying assets and, therefore, should generally not be construed to be a form of credit enhancement.  However, if the advances under such a facility are subordinated to other claims on the cash flows, the facility should be treated as a credit enhancement for purposes of this schedule.

Seller's interest means the reporting bank's ownership interest in loans that have been securitized, except an interest that is a form of recourse or other seller-provided credit enhancement.  Seller's interests should be reported on Schedule RC - Balance Sheet - as securities or as loans depending on the form in which the interest is held.  However, seller's interests differ from the securities issued to investors by the securitization structure.  The principal amount of a seller's interest is generally equal to the total principal amount of the pool of assets included in the securitization structure less the principal amount of those assets attributable to investors, i.e., in the form of securities issued to investors.

Item Instructions

Bank Securitization Activities

NOTE:  After the effective date of FASB Statement No. 166 (codified in FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing) and Statement No. 167 (codified in FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidations), a bank should report information in Schedule RC-S, items 1 through 8, only for those securitizations for which the transferred assets qualify for sale accounting or are otherwise not carried as assets on the bank's consolidated balance sheet.  Thus, if a securitization transaction that qualified for sale accounting prior to the effective date of Statements Nos. 166 and 167 must be brought back onto the reporting bank's consolidated balance sheet upon adoption of these statements, the bank would no longer report information about the securitization in Schedule RC-S, items 1 through 8.</label>

    <label xlink:type="resource" xlink:role="http://www.ffiec.gov/xbrl/report/lineInstruction" xlink:label="ffiec041_pres-RCT_lbl_1971" xml:lang="en">This schedule should be completed on a fully consolidated basis, i.e., including any trust company subsidiary (or subsidiaries) of the reporting institution. For report dates through December 31, 2008, the information reported in Schedule RC-T on fiduciary and related services income (except total gross fiduciary and related services income) and on fiduciary settlements, surcharges, and other losses will not be made available to the public on an individual institution basis. Beginning with the March 31, 2009, report date, all of the information reported in Schedule RC-T for each bank will be publicly available.

Fiduciary and Related Assets

Institutions should generally report fiduciary and related assets using their market value as of the report date. While market value quotations are readily available for marketable securities, many financial and physical assets held in fiduciary accounts are not widely traded or easily valued. If the methodology for determining market values is not set or governed by applicable law (including the terms of the prevailing fiduciary agreement), the institution may use any reasonable method to establish values for fiduciary and related assets for purposes of reporting on this schedule. Reasonable methods include appraised values, book values, or reliable estimates. Valuation methods should be consistent from reporting period to reporting period. This "reasonable method" approach to reporting market values applies both to financial assets that are not marketable and to physical assets. Common physical assets held in fiduciary accounts include real estate, equipment, collectibles, and household goods.

Only those Individual Retirement Accounts, Keogh Plan accounts, Health Savings Accounts, and similar accounts offered through a fiduciary business unit of the reporting institution should be reported in Schedule RC-T. When such accounts are not offered through an institution's fiduciary business unit, they should not be reported in Schedule RC-T. Accounts that consist solely of deposits in the bank itself should not be reported in Schedule RC-T.

If two institutions are named co-fiduciary in the governing instrument, both institutions should report the account. In addition, where one institution contracts with another for fiduciary or related services (i.e., Bank A provides custody services to the trust accounts of Bank B, or Bank A provides investment management services to the trust accounts of Bank B) both institutions should report the accounts in their respective capacities.

Exclude unfunded insurance trusts, testamentary executor appointments, and any other arrangements representing potential future fiduciary accounts.

Asset values reported on this schedule should generally exclude liabilities. For example, an employee benefit account with associated loans against account assets should be reported gross of the outstanding loan balances. As another example, an account with a real estate asset and corresponding mortgage loan should be reported gross of the mortgage liability. However, there are two exceptions. First, for purposes of this schedule, overdrafts should be netted against gross fiduciary assets. Second, the fair value of derivative instruments, as defined in FASB Statement No. 133, should be included in (i.e., netted against) gross assets even if the fair value is negative.

Securities borrowing/lending transactions should be reflected as sales or as secured borrowings according to FASB Statement No. 140. A transferee ("borrower") of securities generally is required to provide "collateral" to the transferor ("lender") of securities. When such transactions do not qualify as sales, securities "lenders" and "borrowers" should account for the transactions as secured borrowings in which cash (or securities that the holder is permitted by contract or custom to sell or repledge) received as "collateral" by the securities "lender" is considered the amount borrowed and the securities "loaned" are considered pledged against the amount borrowed. For purposes of this schedule, securities held in fiduciary accounts that are "loaned" in securities lending transactions (that are accounted for as secured borrowings) should be reported as an asset of the fiduciary account that "loaned" the securities, but the "collateral" received should not also be reported as an asset of this fiduciary account.

In the Fiduciary and Related Assets section, the market value of Collective Investment Fund (CIF) units should be reported along with individual participant accounts in the Column and Item that corresponds to each participant. The aggregate amount of a CIF that is operated by an institution should NOT also be reported as a separate, additional account in the Fiduciary and Related Assets section of this schedule.

Managed Assets - Column A

Report the total market value of assets held in managed fiduciary accounts. An account should be categorized as managed if the institution has investment discretion over the assets of the account. Investment discretion is defined as the sole or shared authority (whether or not that authority is exercised) to determine what securities or other assets to purchase or sell on behalf of the fiduciary related account. An institution that delegates its authority over investments and an institution that receives delegated authority over investments are BOTH deemed to have investment discretion.

Therefore, whether an account where investment discretion has been delegated to a registered investment adviser, whether affiliated or unaffiliated with the reporting institution, should be reported as a managed account depends on whether the delegation of investment authority to the registered investment adviser was made pursuant to the exercise of investment discretion by the reporting institution. If so, the account is deemed to be a managed account by the reporting institution. Otherwise, the account would be a non-managed account for purposes of Schedule RC-T.

An entire account should be reported as either managed or non-managed based on the predominant responsibility of the reporting institution.

Non-Managed Assets - Column B

Report the total market value of assets held in non-managed fiduciary accounts. An account should be categorized as non-managed if the institution does not have investment discretion. Those accounts for which the institution provides a menu of investment options but the ultimate selection authority remains with the account holder or an external manager should be categorized as non-managed. For example, an institution that offers a choice of sweep vehicles is not necessarily exercising investment discretion. The process of narrowing investment options from a range of alternatives does not create a managed fiduciary account for the purposes of this schedule. For example, a 401(k) employee benefit plan where the participants select investments from a list of investment options should be reported as non-managed for the purposes of this schedule.

Number of Managed Accounts - Column C

Report the total number of managed fiduciary accounts.

Number of Non-Managed Accounts - Column D

Report the total number of non-managed fiduciary accounts.

Fiduciary and Related Services Income

The following income categories correspond to the fiduciary asset categories described in Schedule RC-T, items 4 through 11, above. For a detailed definition of the categories, please refer to the corresponding account descriptions. Income and expenses should be reported on an accrual basis. Institutions may report income and expense accounts on a cash basis if the results would not materially differ from those obtained using an accrual basis. For report dates through December 31, 2008, the information reported in Schedule RC-T on fiduciary and related services income (except total gross fiduciary and related services income) will not be made available to the public on an individual institution basis. Beginning with the March 31, 2009, report date, all of the information reported in Schedule RC-T for each bank will be publicly available.</label>

A variable interest entity (VIE), as described in ASC Topic 810, Consolidation (formerly FASB Interpretation No.46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," as amended by FASB Statement No. 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)"), is an entity in which equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for that entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or, as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack one or more of the following three characteristics: (a) the power, through voting rights or similar rights, to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, (b) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (c) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity.

Variable interests in a VIE are contractual, ownership, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity's net assets exclusive of variable interests. When a bank or other company has a variable interest or interests in a VIE, ASC Topic 810 provides guidance for determining whether the bank or other company must consolidate the VIE. If a bank or other company has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and, therefore, must consolidate the VIE. For further information, see the Glossary entry for "variable interest entity."

Schedule RC-V collects information on VIEs that have been consolidated by the reporting bank for purposes of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income because the bank or a consolidated subsidiary is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Schedule RC-V should be completed on a fully consolidated basis, i.e., after eliminating intercompany transactions. The asset and liability amounts to be reported in Schedule RC-V should be the same amounts at which these assets and liabilities are reported on Schedule RC, Balance Sheet, e.g., held-to-maturity securities should be reported at amortized cost and available-for-sale securities should be reported at fair value.

Column Instructions

Column A, Securitization Vehicles: Securitization vehicles include VIEs that have been created to pool and repackage mortgages, other assets, or other credit exposures into securities that can be transferred to investors.

Column B, ABCP Conduits: Asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits include VIEs that primarily issue externally rated commercial paper backed by assets or other exposures.

Column C, Other VIEs: Other VIEs include VIEs other than securitization vehicles and ABCP conduits.
For purposes of Schedule RC-V, information about each consolidated VIE should be included in only one of the three columns of the schedule. The column selected for a particular consolidated VIE should be based on the purpose and design of the VIE and this column should be used consistently over time.</label>

Schedule RI-C is to be completed by institutions with $1 billion or more in total assets.

This schedule has six columns for the disclosure by portfolio category of the balance in the allowance for loan and lease losses at the end of each quarter disaggregated on the basis of the reporting institution's impairment method and the related recorded investment in loans (and, as applicable, leases) held for investment (excluding loans held for investment that the institution has elected to report at fair value under a fair value option) disaggregated in the same manner:  two columns for information on loans individually evaluated for impairment, two columns for information on loans and leases collectively evaluated for impairment, and two columns for purchased credit-impaired loans.  For further information on loan impairment methods, see the Glossary entries for "loan impairment" and "purchased credit-impaired loans and debt securities."

Loans and leases held for investment are loans and leases that the institution has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff. 

The loan and lease portfolio categories for which allowance and related recorded investment amounts are to be reported in Schedule RI-C represent general categories rather than the standardized loan categories defined in Schedule RC-C, part I, Loans and Leases.  Based on the manner in which it segments its portfolio for purposes of applying its allowance methodology, each institution should report each component of the overall allowance reported in Schedule RC, item 4.c, and the recorded investment in the related loans and leases in the Schedule RI-C general loan category that best corresponds to the characteristics of the related loans and leases.[1]  The sum of the recorded investment amounts reported in Schedule RI-C (plus the fair value of loans held for investment for which the fair value option has been elected) must equal the balance sheet amount of held-for-investment loans and leases reported in Schedule RC, item 4.b, "Loans and leases, net of unearned income."

Column Instructions

Columns A and B: For each of the specified general categories of loans held for investment, report in column A the recorded investment in individually evaluated loans that have been determined to be impaired as defined in ASC Subtopic 310-10, Receivables - Overall (formerly FASB Statement No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," as amended), including all loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings, and report in column B the balance of the allowance for loan and lease losses attributable to these individually impaired loans measured in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-10.

Columns C and D: For each of the specified general categories of loans and leases held for investment, report in column C the recorded investment in loans and leases that have been collectively evaluated for impairment in accordance with ASC Subtopic 450-20, Contingencies - Loss Contingencies (formerly FASB Statement No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies") and report in column D the balance in the allowance for loan and lease losses attributable to these collectively evaluated loans and leases measured in accordance with ASC Subtopic 450-20. Also report in column D any unallocated portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses for loans collectively evaluated for impairment.

Columns E and F: For each of the specified general categories of loans held for investment, report in column E the recorded investment in purchased credit-impaired loans as defined in ASC Subtopic 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly AICPA Statement of Position 03-3, "Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer") and report in column F the balance in the allowance for loan and lease losses attributable to these purchased credit-impaired loans measured in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30.



[1]  For example, based on its allowance methodology, one institution's allowance components for credit cards might relate to both consumer and business credit card receivables, but another institution's allowance components for credit cards might relate only to consumer credit card receivables. 
   As another example, based on its allowance methodology, one institution might include its loans secured by farmland in its allowance components for commercial real estate loans, but another institution might include its loans secured by farmland in its allowance components for commercial loans.</label>

Include adjustments of accruals and other accounting estimates made shortly after the end of a reporting period which relate to the income and expense of the reporting period.

A bank that began operating during the year-to-date reporting period should report in the appropriate items of Schedule RI all income earned and expenses incurred since commencing operations.  The bank should report pre-opening income earned and expenses incurred from inception until the date operations commenced using one of the two methods described in the Glossary entry for "start-up activities."

Business Combinations and Push Down Accounting Transactions - If the bank entered into a business combination which became effective during the year-to-date reporting period and which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests, report the income and expense of the combined business for the entire year-to-date.  If the bank entered into a business combination which became effective during the reporting period and which has been accounted for as a purchase, report the income and expense of the acquired bank or business only after its acquisition.  If the bank was acquired in a transaction which became effective during the reporting period and push down accounting was used to account for the acquisition, Schedule RI should only include amounts from the date of the bank's acquisition through the end of the year-to-date reporting period.  For further information on poolings of interests, purchase acquisitions, and push down accounting, see the Glossary entry for "business combinations."

Assets and liabilities accounted under the fair value option - Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) (i.e., FASB Statement No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" (FAS 159); FASB Statement No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments" (FAS 155); and FASB Statement No. 156, "Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets" (FAS 156)), the bank may elect to report certain assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.  This election is generally referred to as the fair value option.  If the bank has elected to apply the fair value option to interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities, it should report the interest income on these financial assets (except any that are in nonaccrual status) and the interest expense on these financial liabilities for the year-to-date in the appropriate interest income and interest expense items on Schedule RI, not as part of the reported change in fair value of these assets and liabilities for the year-to-date.  The bank should measure the interest income or interest expense on a financial asset or liability to which the fair value option has been applied using either the contractual interest rate on the asset or liability or the effective yield method based on the amount at which the asset or liability was first recognized on the balance sheet.  Although the use of the contractual interest rate is an acceptable method under GAAP, when a financial asset or liability has a significant premium or discount upon initial recognition, the measurement of interest income or interest expense under the effective yield method more accurately portrays the economic substance of the transaction.  In addition, in some cases, GAAP requires a particular method of interest income recognition when the fair value option is elected.  For example, when the fair value option has been applied to a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets within the scope of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99-20, "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets," interest income should be measured in accordance with the consensus in this Issue.  Similarly, when the fair value option has been applied to a purchased impaired loan or debt security accounted for under AICPA Statement of Position 03-3, "Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer," interest income on the loan or debt security should be measured in accordance with this Statement of Position when accrual of income is appropriate.  For further information, see the Glossary entry for "Purchased Impaired Loans and Debt Securities."

Revaluation adjustments, excluding amounts reported as interest income and interest expense, to the carrying value of all assets and liabilities reported in Schedule RC at fair value under a fair value option (excluding servicing assets and liabilities reported in Schedule RC, item 10.b, "Other intangible assets," and Schedule RC, item 20, "Other liabilities," respectively, and assets and liabilities reported in Schedule RC, item 5, "Trading assets," and Schedule RC, item 15, "Trading liabilities," respectively) resulting from the periodic marking of such assets and liabilities to fair value should be reported as "Other noninterest income" in Schedule RI, item 5.l.</label>
